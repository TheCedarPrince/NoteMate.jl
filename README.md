> The perfect companion for working with your notes üìö

`NoteMate.jl` is a programmatic transformation tool used to parse and manipulate notes whose structure follows the [Open Knowledge Model (OKM)](https://jacobzelko.com/04172022033744-open-knowledge-standard/index.html).
The goal of `NoteMate.jl` is to enable one to focus only on writing without worry of needing to add any special markup to your note *while* having the benefits of quickly sharing thoughts.
In fact, sharing your thoughts, whether locally or on the internet, is never far away as `NoteMate.jl` provides tools to enable your thoughts to be published on [digital gardens](https://www.lekoarts.de/garden/what-is-a-digital-garden).
Finally, due to the way `NoteMate.jl` parses documents, `NoteMate.jl` can transform notes following the OKM and express them in different outputs irrespective of the implementation.
