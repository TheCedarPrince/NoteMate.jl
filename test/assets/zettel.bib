  abstract = {Abstract             There have been over 100 years of literature discussing the deleterious influence of racism on health. Much of the literature describes racism as a driver of social determinants of health, such as housing, employment, income, and education. More recently, increased attention has been given to measuring the structural nature of a system that advantages one racialized group over others rather than solely relying on individual acknowledgement of racism. Despite these advances, there is still a need for methodological and analytical approaches to complement the aforementioned. This commentary calls on epidemiologists and other health researchers at large to engage the discourse on measuring structural racism. First, we address the conflation between race and racism in epidemiologic research. Next, we offer methodological recommendations (linking of interdisciplinary variables and data sets and leveraging mixed-method and life-course approaches) and analytical recommendations (integration of mixed data, use of multidimensional models) that epidemiologists and other health researchers may consider in health equity research. The goal of this commentary is to inspire the use of up-to-date and theoretically driven approaches to increase discourse among public health researchers on capturing racism as well as to improve evidence of its role as the fundamental cause of racial health inequities.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Health disparities between individuals of African and European ancestry are well documented. The disparities in bipolar disorder may be driven by racial bias superimposed on established factors contributing to misdiagnosis, including: evolving empirically based diagnostic criteria (International Classification of Diseases [ICD], Research Diagnostic Criteria [RDC] and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM]), multiple symptom domains (i.e. mania, depression and psychosis), and multimodal medical and additional psychiatric comorbidity. METHODS: For this paper, we reviewed the phenomenological differences between bipolar individuals of African and European ancestry in the context of diagnostic criteria and clinical factors that may contribute to a potential racial bias. RESULTS: Published data show that bipolar persons of African ancestry, compared with bipolar persons of non-African ancestry, are more often misdiagnosed with a disease other than bipolar disorder (i.e. schizophrenia). Additionally, studies show that there are disparities in recruiting patients of African ancestry to participate in important genomic studies. This gap in biological research in this underrepresented minority may represent a missed opportunity to address potential racial differences in the risk and course of bipolar illness. CONCLUSION: A concerted effort by the research community to increase inclusion of diverse persons in studies of bipolar disorder through community engagement may facilitate fully addressing these diagnostic and treatment disparities in bipolar individuals of African ancestry.},

  abstract = {The current diagnosis process of dementia is resulting in a high percentage of cases with delayed detection. To address this problem, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of autonomously detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the older adult population. We implement a signal processing approach equipped with a machine learning paradigm to process and analyze real-world data acquired using home-based unobtrusive sensing technologies. Using the sensor and clinical data pertaining to 97 subjects, acquired over an average period of three years, a number of measures associated with the subjects’ walking speed and general activity in the home were calculated. Different time spans of these measures were used to generate feature vectors to train and test two machine learning algorithms namely support vector machines and random forests. We were able to autonomously detect MCI in older adults with an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.93 using a time window of 24 weeks. This study is of great significance since it can potentially assist in the early detection of cognitive impairment in older adults.},

  abstract = {A retrospective data analysis using 2004–2014 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample was conducted to examine in-hospital mortality among adults with autism spectrum disorders in the United States compared to individuals in the general population. We modeled logistic regressions to compare inpatient hospital mortality between adults with autism spectrum disorders (n\,=\,34,237) and age-matched and sex-matched controls (n\,=\,102,711) in a 1:3 ratio. Adults with autism spectrum disorders had higher odds for inpatient hospital mortality than controls (odds ratio\,=\,1.44, 95\% confidence interval: 1.29–1.61, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). This risk remained high even after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, number of comorbidities, epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidities, hospital bed size, hospital region, and hospitalization year (odds ratio\,=\,1.51, 95\% confidence interval: 1.33–1.72, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Adults with autism spectrum disorders who experienced in-hospital mortality had a higher risk for having 10 out of 27 observed Elixhauser-based medical comorbidities at the time of death, including psychoses, other neurological disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis collagen vascular disease, obesity, weight loss, fluid and electrolyte disorders, deficiency anemias, and paralysis. The results from the interaction of sex and autism spectrum disorders status suggest that women with autism spectrum disorders have almost two times higher odds for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio\,=\,1.95, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) than men with autism spectrum disorders. The results from the stratified analysis also showed that women with autism spectrum disorders had 3.17 times higher odds (95\% confidence interval: 2.50–4.01, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) of in-hospital mortality compared to women from the non–autism spectrum disorders matched control group; this difference persisted even after adjusting for socioeconomic, clinical, and hospital characteristics (odds ratio\,=\,2.75, 95\% confidence interval: 2.09–3.64, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Our findings underscore the need for more research to develop better strategies for healthcare and service delivery to people with autism spectrum disorders.},

Terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Terrorism is detrimental for mental health, premature mortality, and economic losses and undermines the central tenets of public health to improve the health and well-being of populations. Despite the impact terrorism has on avoidable morbidity and mortality, population health research largely overlooks social determinants of terrorism and risk factors that contribute to terrorist activities. Methods: Drawing from what is known about commonly studied social determinants of health topics, including the relationships between structural and interpersonal discrimination, social cohesion, and gang violence and health, we present a public health framework, rooted in the social determinants of health, for identifying potential factors influencing terrorism and violent radicalization. Results: Social determinants of health provide unique insight into how interpersonal and structural factors can influence risk for violent radicalization and terrorist activity. Each of the topics we review provides an entry point for existing public health and behavioral science knowledge to be used in preventing and understanding violent radicalization and terrorism. For example, anti-Muslim sentiment has promoted discrimination against Muslims, while also serving to marginalize and stigmatize Muslim communities. These conditions limit the social resources, like social cohesion, that Muslims have access to and make political violence more appealing to some. Conclusions: Public health can contribute much to the ongoing debate around terrorism. The field must take a more prevention-focused approach to the problem of terrorism.

Different coating solutions were prepared by solubilizing chitosan, which was obtained from the residual chitinous material, in lactic acid and blending it with the various recovered materials. Chitosan-based solutions were tested for their viscosity and their antioxidative and antimicrobial properties against 26 selected microbial strains.

The incorporation of an astaxanthin-rich protein concentrate increased the antimicrobial capacity of the blend solution, but no further effect was observed after extra addition of the carotenoid extract.},

  abstract = {Chitin extraction by biological way, using the lactobacilli Lactobacillus helveticus, is a non-polluting method and offers the opportunity to preserve the exceptional qualities of chitin and its derivatives. However, the major disadvantage of the fermentative way is the low efficiency of demineralization and deproteinization. The aim of our study is to improve the yield of extraction. Many factors, such as the initial concentration of carbon source, fermentation time, incubation temperature, inoculum size, shell size, volume and medium composition have been reported to influence the fermentation process and consequently demineralization and deproteinization efficiency. Based on the use of central composite design and response surface methodology ten factors with three levels each were examined to determine the optimal operational conditions of demineralization and deproteinization. The analysis of the obtained results showed that the optimal conditions of 98\% of demineralization and 78\% of deproteinisation are 171.4~g~L−1 of reducing sugars, 2.03~g of nitrogen source [(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2] and 1.29~g of calcium source (CaCl2), used to ferment 4.84~g of shells, of 1.053~mm size heat treated at 120~°C, with 10~mL of inoculum (L.~helveticus) incubated at 32.1~°C in 100~mL of juice date for 254.38~h (15 days).},

Common Voice is designed for Automatic Speech Recognition purposes but can be useful in other domains (e.g. language identification). To achieve scale and sustainability, the Common Voice project employs crowdsourcing for both data collection and data validation. The most recent release includes 29 languages, and as of November 2019 there are a total of 38 languages collecting data. Over 50,000 individuals have participated so far, resulting in 2,500 hours of collected audio. To our knowledge this is the largest audio corpus in the public domain for speech recognition, both in terms of number of hours and number of languages. As an example use case for Common Voice, we present speech recognition experiments using Mozilla’s DeepSpeech Speech-to-Text toolkit. By applying transfer learning from a source English model, we find an average Character Error Rate improvement of 5.99 ± 5.48 for twelve target languages (German, French, Italian, Turkish, Catalan, Slovenian, Welsh, Irish, Breton, Tatar, Chuvash, and Kabyle). For most of these languages, these are the first ever published results on end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition.},

Further, we hypothesized that momentarily deactivating this goal (via a switch in tasks) would prevent the activation level of the vigilance goal from ever habituating. We asked observers to perform a visual vigilance task while maintaining digits in-memory. When observers retrieved the digits at the end of the vigilance task, their vigilance performance steeply declined over time. However, when observers were asked to sporadically recollect the digits during the vigilance task, the vigilance decrement was averted. Our results present a direct challenge to the pervasive view that vigilance decrements are due to a depletion of attentional resources and provide a tractable mechanism to prevent this insidious phenomenon in everyday life.},

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

  abstract = {With increasing availability of smartphones with GPS capabilities, large-scale studies relating individual-level mobility patterns to a wide variety of patient-centered outcomes, from mood disorders to surgical recovery, are becoming a reality. Similar past studies have been small in scale and have provided wearable GPS devices to subjects. These devices typically collect mobility traces continuously without significant gaps in the data, and consequently the problem of data missingness has been safely ignored. Leveraging subjects' own smartphones makes it possible to scale up and extend the duration of these types of studies, but at the same time introduces a substantial challenge: to preserve a smartphone's battery, GPS can be active only for a small portion of the time, frequently less than \$10\textbackslash\%\$, leading to a tremendous missing data problem. We introduce a principled statistical approach, based on weighted resampling of the observed data, to impute the missing mobility traces, which we then summarize using different mobility measures. We compare the strengths of our approach to linear interpolation, a popular approach for dealing with missing data, both analytically and through simulation of missingness for empirical data. We conclude that our imputation approach better mirrors human mobility both theoretically and over a sample of GPS mobility traces from 182 individuals in the Geolife data set, where, relative to linear interpolation, imputation resulted in a 10-fold reduction in the error averaged across all mobility features.},

Novel computerized methods to characterize complex behaviors such as speech could be used to identify and predict psychiatric illness in individuals. AIMS: In this proof-of-principle study, our aim was to test automated speech analyses combined with Machine Learning to predict later psychosis onset in youths at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. METHODS: Thirty-four CHR youths (11 females) had baseline interviews and were assessed quarterly for up to 2.5 years; five transitioned to psychosis. Using automated analysis, transcripts of interviews were evaluated for semantic and syntactic features predicting later psychosis onset. Speech features were fed into a convex hull classification algorithm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess their predictive value for psychosis outcome. The canonical correlation between the speech features and prodromal symptom ratings was computed. RESULTS: Derived speech features included a Latent Semantic Analysis measure of semantic coherence and two syntactic markers of speech complexity: maximum phrase length and use of determiners (e.g., which). These speech features predicted later psychosis development with 100\% accuracy, outperforming classification from clinical interviews. Speech features were significantly correlated with prodromal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the utility of automated speech analysis to measure subtle, clinically relevant mental state changes in emergent psychosis. Recent developments in computer science, including natural language processing, could provide the foundation for future development of objective clinical tests for psychiatry. npj Schizophrenia (2015) 1, Article number: 15030; doi:10.1038/npjschz.2015.30; published online 26 August 2015},

Prevalence of mixed depression, a combination of depression and manic or hypomanic symptoms, is high in patients with bipolar disorders. Controlled studies are needed to investigate treatment of mixed depression; antidepressants can worsen manic and hypomanic symptoms, and mood stabilising agents might be necessary.},

RESULTS Of the 3084 children in the study (1128 girls and 1956 boys; mean [SD] age, 7.03 [5.44] years), 1002 (32.4\%) underwent ICP monitoring, with substantial hospital variation (6\% to 50\% by hospital). Overall, 484 children (15.7\%) experienced the primary composite outcome. A propensity approach using matching weights generated good covariate balance between those who did and those who did not undergo ICP monitoring. Using a propensity-weighted logistic regression model clustered by hospital, no statistically significant difference was found in functional survival between monitored and unmonitored patients (odds ratio of poor outcome among those who underwent ICP monitoring, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.74). In a prespecified secondary analysis, no difference in mortality was found (odds ratio, 1.16; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.50). Prespecified subgroup analyses of children younger and older than 2 years of age and among those with unintentional and inflicted (intentional) injuries also showed no difference in outcome with ICP monitoring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE With the use of linked national data and validated computable phenotypes, no evidence was found of a benefit from ICP monitoring on functional survival of children with severe TBI. Intracranial pressure monitoring is a widely but inconsistently used technology with incompletely demonstrated effectiveness. A large prospective cohort study or randomized trial is needed.},

  abstract = {Patients with schizophrenia often display impairments in the expression of emotion and speech and those are observed in their facial behaviour. Automatic analysis of patients’ facial expressions that is aimed at estimating symptoms of schizophrenia has received attention recently. However, the datasets that are typically used for training and evaluating the developed methods, contain only a small number of patients (4-34) and are recorded while the subjects were performing controlled tasks such as listening to life vignettes, or answering emotional questions. In this paper, we use videos of professional-patient interviews, in which symptoms were assessed in a standardised way as they should/may be assessed in practice, and which were recorded in realistic conditions (i.e. varying illumination levels and camera viewpoints) at the patients’ homes or at mental health services. We automatically analyse the facial behaviour of 91 out-patients – this is almost 3 times the number of patients in other studies – and propose SchiNet, a novel neural network architecture that estimates expression-related symptoms in two different assessment interviews. We evaluate the proposed SchiNet for patient-independent prediction of symptoms of schizophrenia. Experimental results show that some automatically detected facial expressions are significantly correlated to symptoms of schizophrenia, and that the proposed network for estimating symptom severity delivers promising results.},

Time courses of low frequency ({$<$} 0.1 Hz) fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of temporal correlation (P {$<$} 10(-3)) within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor function.

  abstract = {The monitoring of sleep by quantifying sleeping time and quality is pivotal in many preventive health care scenarios. A substantial amount of wearable sensing products have been introduced to the market for just this reason, detecting whether the user is either sleeping or awake. Assessing these devices for their accuracy in estimating sleep is a daunting task, as their hardware design tends to be different and many are closed-source systems that have not been clinically tested. In this paper, we present a challenging benchmark dataset from an open source wrist-worn data logger that contains relatively high-frequent (100Hz) 3D inertial data from 42 sleep lab patients, along with their data from clinical polysomnography. We analyse this dataset with two traditional approaches for detecting sleep and wake states and propose a new algorithm specifically for 3D acceleration data, which operates on a principle of Estimation of Stationary Sleep-segments (ESS). Results show that all three methods generally over-estimate for sleep, with our method performing slightly better (almost 79\% overall median accuracy) than the traditional activity count-based methods.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite decades of research and interventions, significant health disparities persist. Seventeen years is the estimated time to translate scientific discoveries into public health action. This Narrative Review argues that the translation process could be accelerated if representative data were gathered and used in more innovative and efficient ways. Methods: The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities led a multiyear visioning process to identify research opportunities designed to frame the next decade of research and actions to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. ‘‘Big data’’ was identified as a research opportunity and experts collaborated on a systematic vision of how to use big data both to improve the granularity of information for place-based study and to efficiently translate health disparities research into improved population health. This Narrative Review is the result of that collaboration. Results: Big data could enhance the process of translating scientific findings into reduced health disparities by contributing information at fine spatial and temporal scales suited to interventions. In addition, big data could fill pressing needs for health care system, genomic, and social determinant data to understand mechanisms. Finally, big data could lead to appropriately personalized health care for demographic groups. Rich new resources, including social media, electronic health records, sensor information from digital devices, and crowd-sourced and citizen-collected data, have the potential to complement more traditional data from health surveys, administrative data, and investigator-initiated registries or cohorts. This Narrative Review argues for a renewed focus on translational research cycles to accomplish this continual assessment. Conclusion: The promise of big data extends from etiology research to the evaluation of large-scale interventions and offers the opportunity to accelerate translation of health disparities studies. This data-rich world for health disparities research, however, will require continual assessment for efficacy, ethical rigor, and potential algorithmic or system bias.},

  abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

  abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States with a high economic burden due to readmissions. We present a novel approach to remotely monitor quality of life in patients with HF using a smartphone app and a scalable cloud-based architecture. In a preliminary study, we assess continuous data from 10 HF subjects over a period of up to a year. Over 680 million samples of physical movement data, 9,000 geographic location updates, and 11,000 individual social networking events in the form of phone calls were captured from the app. Personalized models were constructed from these data to estimate self-reported quality of life using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), which has been shown to be a reliable health status measure for HF patients. Generalized linear models using only activity features were shown to reliably estimate the KCCQ score with an out of sample mean absolute error of 5.71\%. Personalized models for estimating the HF severity as mild or severe were also built as a proof of concept to detect when a subject’s data indicated a clinical deterioration. Average out of sample accuracy was 83\% for this binary classification problem. Creation of personalized models from passive smartphone data collected ‘in-the-wild’ to identify changes in HF severity appears possible. This new approach holds promise as a low burden and accurate method of monitoring HF symptoms, which could aid clinicians in early assessment and prevention of adverse outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a large group community-based behavioral smoking cessation intervention over an 8-year follow-up period and to determine precessation predictors of cessation at each follow-up time. Research Approach: Behavioral intervention followed by three longitudinal follow-up interviews. Setting: Regional Outpatient Cancer Centre. Study Participants: 971 participants in smoking cessation clinics held between 1986 and 1990. Intervention: Eight 90-minute sessions over 4 months utilizing education, self-monitoring, nicotine fading, a group quit date and behavioral modification techniques. Up to 110 smokers participated in each group program. Main Outcome Measures: Cessation rates at 3, 6, and 12 months postquit and at 8-year follow-up. Differences between successful and unsuccessful participants in precessation demographic, smoking history, and smoking behavior variables. Results: At 3 months postquit date, 39.3\% of the 971 participants reported that they were not smoking, decreasing to 32.1\% at 6 months and 26.0\% at 12 months. At the 8-year follow-up, 33.9\% of the original sample were contacted, and of those, 47.7\% reported that they were currently not smoking. There were nine predictors of cessation at the end of the program (3 months), which were similar to those previously reported in the literature. Similarly, at 6 and 12 months, six factors were associated with not smoking. At the 9-year follow-up the only variable predictive of continued abstinence was being female (p Ͻ .05). Conclusions: This program was successful in promoting smoking cessation and maintenance, even with its large-group format. Predictive factors were similar to those previously reported in the literature. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

An interactive entity is modeled as a finite-state machine. A functional gesture is defined as the semantic meaning of an event that triggers a state transition and not as the movement to be performed. An interaction scenario has been designed in order to evaluate the features of the proposed model and to investigate how its application can enhance a post-WIMP human-environment interaction.},

Case and Deaton argue that market and political power in the United States have moved away from labor towards capital-as unions have weakened and politics have become more favorable to business, corporations have become more powerful. Consolidation in some American industries, healthcare especially, has brought an increase in monopoly power in some product markets so that it is possible for firms to raise prices above what they would be in a freely competitive market. This, the authors argue, is a major cause of wage stagnation among working-class Americans and has played a substantial role in the increase in deaths of despair. Case and Deaton offer a way forward, including ideas that, even in our current political situation, may be feasible and improve lives"--},

  abstract = {Background: While recent reports suggest that people with disabilities (PwDs) are likely to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and face multiple challenges, previous research has not examined if COVID-19 burdens are unequally distributed with respect to the disability characteristics of the U.S. population. Objective: This article presents the first national scale study of the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and disability characteristics in the U.S. The objective is to determine whether COVID-19 incidence is significantly greater in counties containing higher percentages of socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs, based on race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and biological sex. Methods: This study integrates county-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database with multiple disability variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that consider spatial clustering in the data. Results: Greater COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly associated with: (1) higher percentages of PwDs who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, below poverty, under 18 years of age, and female; and (2) lower percentages of PwDs who are non-Hispanic White, above poverty, aged 65 or more years, and male, after controlling for spatial clustering. Conclusions: Socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher COVID-19 incidence compared to other PwDs. These findings represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on PwDs and highlight the urgent need for COVID-19 data collection systems to incorporate disability information.},

  abstract = {Background: Use of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in consumer products is resulting in NPs in drinking water sources. Subsequent NP breakthrough into treated drinking water is a potential exposure route and human health threat. Objectives: In this study we investigated the breakthrough of common NPs-silver (Ag), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and zinc oxide (ZnO)-into finished drinking water following conventional and advanced treatment. Methods: NPs were spiked into five experimental waters: groundwater, surface water, synthetic freshwater, synthetic freshwater containing natural organic matter, and tertiary wastewater effluent. Bench-scale coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation simulated conventional treatment, and microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) simulated advanced treatment. We monitored breakthrough of NPs into treated water by turbidity removal and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: Conventional treatment resulted in 2-20\%, 3-8\%, and 48-99\% of Ag, TiO2, and ZnO NPs, respectively, or their dissolved ions remaining in finished water. Breakthrough following MF was 1-45\% for Ag, 0-44\% for TiO2, and 36-83\% for ZnO. With UF, NP breakthrough was 0-2\%, 0-4\%, and 2-96\% for Ag, TiO2, and ZnO, respectively. Variability was dependent on NP stability, with less breakthrough of aggregated NPs compared with stable NPs and dissolved NP ions. Conclusions: Although a majority of aggregated or stable NPs were removed by simulated conÂ­ventional and advanced treatment, NP metals were detectable in finished water. As environmental NP concentrations increase, we need to consider NPs as emerging drinking water contaminants and determine appropriate drinking water treatment processes to fully remove NPs in order to reduce their potential harmful health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and fatalities worldwide. Outbreaks in U.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff connections between nursing homes—and the role these connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection—is currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility employment. We perform the first large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff and contractors using devicelevel geolocation data from 50 million smartphones, and find that 5.1 percent of smartphone users who visit a nursing home for at least one hour also visit another facility during our 11-week study period—even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of connectedness and estimate that nursing homes, on average, share connections with 7 other facilities. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a home’s staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict COVID-19 cases. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. Multivariate regressions comparing demographically and geographically similar nursing homes suggest that 49 percent of COVID cases among nursing home residents are attributable to staff movement between facilities.},

  abstract = {Objective: To describe how criteria for amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) have been operationalised in randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Design: Systematic review. Information sources: EMBASE, PubMed and PSYCHInfo were searched from their inception to February 2012. Electronic clinical trial registries were also searched (February 2012). Study selection: RCTs were included where participant selection was made using Petersen et al-defined aMCI. There was no restriction on intervention type or the outcome tested. Data extraction: For each trial, we extracted information on study design, demographics, exclusion criteria and the operationalisation strategy for the five aMCI diagnostic criteria including: (1) memory complaint, (2) normal general cognitive function, (3) memory impairment, (4) no functional impairment and (5) no dementia. Results: 223 articles and 278 registered trials were reviewed, of which 22 met inclusion criteria. Various methods were applied for operationalising aMCI criteria resulting in variability in participant selection. Memory complaint and assessment of general cognitive function were the most consistently measured criteria. There was large heterogeneity in the neuropsychological methods used to determine memory impairment. It was not possible to assess the impact of these differences on case selection accuracy for dementia prediction. Further limitations include selective and unclear reporting of how each of the criteria was measured. Conclusions: The results highlight the urgent need for a standardised approach to map aMCI. Lack of uniformity in clinical diagnosis, however, is not exclusively a problem for MCI but also for other clinical states such as dementia including Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy Body, frontotemporal or vascular dementia. Defining a uniform approach to MCI classification, or indeed for any classification concept within the field of dementia, should be a priority if further trials are to be undertaken in the older aged population based on these concepts.},

  abstract = {Background: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show unusual social behaviors and repetitive behaviors. Some of these behaviors, e.g., time spent in an area or turning rate/direction, can be automatically tracked. Automated tracking has several advantages over subjective ratings including reliability, amount of information provided, and consistency across laboratories, and is potentially of importance for diagnosis, animal models and objective assessment of treatment efficacy. However, its validity for ASD has not been examined. In this exploratory study, we examined associations between rating scale data with automated tracking of children’s movements using the Noldus EthoVision XT system; i.e., tracking not involving a human observer. Based on our observations and previous research, we predicted that time spent in the periphery of the room would be associated with autism severity and that rate and direction of turning would be associated with stereotypies. Methods: Children with and without ASD were observed in a free-play situation for 3 min before and 3 min after Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale – Generic (ADOS-G) testing. The Noldus system provided measures of the rate and direction of turning, latency to approach and time spend near the periphery or the parent. Results: Ratings of the severity of maladaptive social behaviors, stereotypies, autism severity, and arousal problems were positively correlated with increases in percent time spent in the periphery in the total sample and in the ASD subset. Adaptive social communication skills decreased with increases in the percentage of time spent in the periphery and increases in the latency to approach the parent in the ASD group. The rate and direction of turning was linked with stereotypies only in the group without ASD (the faster the rate of a turn to the left, the worse the rating). In the ASD group, there was a shift from a neutral turning bias prior to the ADOS assessment to a strong left turn bias after the ADOS assessment. In the entire sample, this left turn bias was associated with measures of autism severity. Conclusion: Results suggest that automated tracking yields valid and unbiased information for assessing children with autism. Turning bias is an interesting and unexplored measure related to autism.},

  abstract = {Speech deficits, notably those involved in psychomotor retardation, blunted affect, alogia and poverty of content of speech, are pronounced in a wide range of serious mental illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia, unipolar depression, bipolar disorders). The present project evaluated the degree to which these deficits manifest as a function of cognitive resource limitations. We examined natural speech from 52 patients meeting criteria for serious mental illnesses (i.e., severe functional deficits with a concomitant diagnosis of schizophrenia, unipolar and/or bipolar affective disorders) and 30 non-psychiatric controls using a range of objective, computer-based measures tapping speech production (“alogia”), variability (“blunted vocal affect”) and content (“poverty of content of speech”). Subjects produced natural speech during a baseline condition and while engaging in an experimentally-manipulated cognitively-effortful task. For correlational analysis, cognitive ability was measured using a standardized battery. Generally speaking, speech deficits did not differ as a function of SMI diagnosis. However, every speech production and content measure was significantly abnormal in SMI versus control groups. Speech variability measures generally did not differ between groups. For both patients and controls as a group, speech during the cognitively-effortful task was sparser and less rich in content. Relative to controls, patients were abnormal under cognitive load with respect only to average pause length. Correlations between the speech variables and cognitive ability were only significant for this same variable: average pause length. Results suggest that certain speech deficits, notably involving pause length, may manifest as a function of cognitive resource limitations. Implications for treatment, research and assessment are discussed.},

  abstract = {Introduction: While amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI) are theoretically different entities, only a few investigations studied the structural brain differences between these subtypes of mild cognitive impairment. The aim of the study was to find the structural differences between aMCI and naMCI, and to replicate previous findings on the differentiation between aMCI and healthy controls. Methods: Altogether 62 aMCI, naMCI, and healthy control subjects were included into the study based on the Petersen criteria. All patients underwent a routine brain MR examination, and a detailed neuropsychological examination. Results: The sizes of the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala were decreased in aMCI relative to naMCI and to controls. Furthermore the cortical thickness of the entorhinal cortex, the fusiform gyrus, the precuneus and the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus were significantly decreased in aMCI relative to naMCI and healthy controls. The largest differences relative to controls were detected for the volume of the hippocampus (18\% decrease vs. controls) and the cortical thickness (20\% decrease vs. controls) of the entorhinal cortex: 1.6 and 1.4 in terms of Cohen’s d. Only the volume of the precuneus were decreased in the naMCI group (5\% decrease) compared to the control subjects: 0.9 in terms of Cohen’s d. Significant between group differences were also found in the neuropsychological test results: a decreased anterograde, retrograde memory, and category fluency performance was detected in the aMCI group relative to controls and naMCI subjects. Subjects with naMCI showed decreased letter fluency relative to controls, while both MCI groups showed decreased executive functioning relative to controls as measured by the Trail Making test part B. Memory performance in the aMCI group and in the entire sample correlated with the thickness of the entorhinal cortex and with the volume of the amygdala. Conclusion: The amnestic mild cognitive impairment/non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment separation is not only theoretical but backed by structural imaging methods and neuropsychological tests. A better knowledge of the MCI subtypes can help to predict the direction of progression and create targeted prevention.},

All participants indicated strong social support during pregnancy. Late initiators, particularly multiparous women, perceived clinic staff to be insensitive. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide valuable insight into overcoming barriers to early initiation of prenatal care among low SES Black women.},

  abstract = {The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real-world entities are modeled in the database. "A database schema specifies, based on the database administrator's knowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the database, or those of interest to the possible end-users." The notion of a database schema plays the same role as the notion of theory in predicate calculus. A model of this "theory" closely corresponds to a database, which can be seen at any instant of time as a mathematical object. Thus a schema can contain formulas representing integrity constraints specifically for an application and the constraints specifically for a type of database, all expressed in the same database language. In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, packages, procedures, functions, queues, triggers, types, sequences, materialized views, synonyms, database links, directories, XML schemas, and other elements. A database generally stores its schema in a data dictionary. Although a schema is defined in text database language, the term is often used to refer to a graphical depiction of the database structure. In other words, schema is the structure of the database that defines the objects in the database. In an Oracle Database system, the term "schema" has a slightly different connotation.},

  abstract = {We here present a new technique for visualizing the temporal dynamics of brain area activation and interaction at high-temporal resolution. We ÿrst applied independent component analysis to concatenated single-trial EEG data from a fast go–nogo categorization task of natural images and showed that individual independent components might index neural synchrony within and between intracranial brain sources. We used time-frequency decomposition to model their dynamic interactions. In particular, following stimulus presentations, we showed that several independent components were activated and synchronized in the theta frequency range (near 4 Hz). c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

I consider nine possible impediments to the implementation of research findings in the classroom in an effort to determine which, if any, apply to the spacing effect. I conclude that the apparent absence o f systematic application may be due, in part, to the ahistorical character of research on the spacing effect and certain gaps in our understanding of both the spacing effect and classroom practice. However, because none of these concerns seems especially discouraging, and in view of what we do know about the spacing effect, classroom application is recommended.},

In COVID-19 physiopathology, one of the main inflammation mechanisms is the “cytokine storm”, causing a pro-inflammatory state, related to cardiac and pulmonary damage. There is also a less effective role of lymphocyte B and T in the humoral immunity due to the reduction of their proliferative response. The physiopathology of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level, such as the increase of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels. We hypothesize that ASD could be a risk-factor as the other conditions are.},

On one hand, behavioral symptoms in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can indicate an increased risk of progressing to dementia. On the other hand, mild behavioral impairment (MBI) in patients who usually have normal cognition indicates an increased risk of developing dementia. Whatever the cause, all dementias carry a high rate of NPI. These symptoms can be observed at any stage of the disease, may fluctuate over its course, are a leading cause of stress and overload for caregivers, and increase rates of hospitalization and early institutionalization for patients with dementia. The clinician should be able to promptly recognize NPI through the use of instruments capable of measuring their frequency and severity to support diagnosis, and to help monitor the treatment of behavioral symptoms. The aims of this review are to describe and update the construct ‘MBI’ and to revise the reported NPS related to prodromal stages of dementia (MCI and MBI) and dementia stages of Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.},

  abstract = {Objective.{$\quad$} Violence in post-conflict Guatemala has serious public health consequences for the population. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between violence and social capital.   Methods.{$\quad$} Data from a cross-sectional victimization survey conducted in 2008–2010 in Guatemala were analyzed. Two-stage proportionate sampling was used in the survey. Households (n = 1 300) were randomly sampled within a random sample of communities (n = 118) in five administrative departments. The survey collected information on the six-month violence exposure of 6 335 individuals. Social capital was measured at the household level using the short version of the Adapted Social Capital Tool (SASCAT). The odds ratio for household violence exposure was estimated using multiple logistic regression. Community-level data from the latest national census were included as explanatory factors at the community level. Income, ethnicity, and social capital were included at the household level. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0.   Results.{$\quad$} In total, 2.7\% of individuals and 11.7\% of households had been exposed to violence within the past six months. The multivariate analysis showed that 1) structural social capital (in this case, the level of participation in social networks and civil society) was a risk factor for violence and 2) cognitive social capital (measured as trust, norms, and sense of belonging) was a protective factor for violence.   Conclusions.{$\quad$} The opposite direction of the association between violence and structural and cognitive social capital challenges the use of social capital as a unified concept. If this finding is corroborated by other studies, structural and cognitive social capital will have to be treated as two distinctly different concepts.},

  abstract = {The bactericidal efficiency of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) was evaluated against bacteria isolated from surface and ground water samples in Egypt. The AgNP were synthesized by typical one-step synthesis protocol, and were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The bactericidal efficiency of AgNP was evaluated by its application in three concentrations i.e., 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 ppm to water sample, and allowed to interact with bacteria for different duration e.g., 5 min 15 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h. Then, the bactericidal efficiency of AgNPs was determined by comparing the counted bacteria before and after the treatments. Higher mean values of total bacterial count (TBC), total coliform count (TCC), and total streptococcal count (TFS) were detected in surface water than in ground water. Also, the results showed that TBC, TCC and TFS exceeded permissible limits. Application of AgNP at different concentration, the number of bacteria in TBC was significantly reduced in all AgNP-exposed samples as compared to the control group (p{$<$}0.05). The highest concentration of AgNP exhibited highest bactericidal efficiency in TBC, where, after two hours, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 mg/L AgNP was found to be sufficient to inhibit 91.85, 89.14 and 74.92\%, and 92.33, 85.23 and 53.17\% in TBC of surface and ground water, respectively. Moreover, the inhibition efficiency of the highest concentration (0.1 ppm) against TCC reached to 98.10 and 99.88\% in surface water and 95.54 and 99.20\% in ground water after 1 h and 2 h, respectively. Similar results were found against TFS count. The AgNPs were found to be effective against bacteria of water origin. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {While advances in medical care have reduced mortality rates across the globe, perinatal mortality has decreased at a slower pace. This is particularly true of low- and middle-income countries, which contribute by far the largest proportion of perinatal deaths annually. Key reasons for this include lack of systematic screening, lack of early health advice-seeking and robust referral. To address these issues we are developing a scalable mHealth referral system embedded into an existing network of practising traditional birth attendants. Two off-theshelf sensors are bundled into the intervention, a 1D Doppler foetal heart monitor (cost \$35) and a pulse oximeter, to address key clinical perinatal complications: the detection of foetal distress and intrauterine growth restriction by automatic algorithmic analysis of the Doppler ultrasound signal. The devices directly interface with the smartphone for data transfer and to enable on-the-spot assessment. For the development of our system we partnered with a local healthcare NGO working in rural Guatemala, one of the poorest regions in Latin America. For the first time, the systemic barriers to maternal-child care posed by the acute lack of access to basic diagnostic technology, decision support, and reliable linkages between lay birth attendants and higher levels of care will be addressed. An initial usability study has been conducted to assess the feasibility of introducing the proposed system for use by frontline health care workers. The high rate of successful signal recordings and the positive feedback on system use and utility are encouraging indicators that, by bringing together engineers, physicians, public health workers, anthropologists, and local NGOs, we are developing an intuitive system capable in assisting practicing birth attendants to elevate the level of services they provide.},

  abstract = {Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is reported to be associated with cognitive decline and dementia, in particular vascular dementia. However, the evidence linking MetS to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a precursor of AD, is inconsistent and limited. This study examined the association of MetS and its components with aMCI and how APOE-␧e4 and younger age influenced this association. Participants with aMCI (n = 98) and cognitively normal controls (n = 802) were identified from baseline data in a second wave cohort of older subjects aged 55 and over in the Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Study-2 (SLAS-2) in 2009/2010. The associations of MetS and its individual components with aMCI were analyzed using logistic regression controlling for age, gender, education, current smoking, alcohol drink, leisure time activities score, Geriatric Depression Scale score, APOE-␧4, and heart disease or stroke. The analysis was repeated for associations stratified by age and APOE-␧4 status. In multivariate analysis, MetS was associated with an elevated risk of aMCI (OR = 1.79; 95\% CI 1.15–2.77). Among MetS components, central obesity showed a significant association with aMCI (OR = 1.77; 95\%CI 1.11–2.82). The association between MetS and aMCI remained significant on repeated analysis among subjects free of heart disease and stroke. This association was particularly stronger among participants with APOE-␧4 allele (OR = 3.35; 95\% CI, 1.03–10.85) and younger ({$<$}65 years) participants with APOE-␧4 (OR = 6.57; 95\% CI, 1.03–41.74). MetS was found to be associated with aMCI, especially in individuals with APOE-␧4 at younger age in this middle-aged and older cohort.},

Then, we run a series of negative binomial regressions for 110 countries between 1971 and 2007 to test the hypothesis that poor socio-economic development is conducive to terrorism. We find that socio-economic variables indeed matter to terrorism, contrary to other results. Our findings imply that countries can benefit from economic development and growth in terms of a reduction in terrorism.},

It may occur that spurious points appear in the heart rate signal. RHRV allows users to delete these outliers, when necessary. Besides, the signal can be filtered to reject automatically points that do not correspond to acceptable physiological values.},

  abstract = {Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syn­ drome experience repeated periods of apnea and arousal during sleep. A condition which in short term leads to excessive daytime sleepiness and in the long term may have clinical consequences such as stroke and cardiovascular abnormalities. Although complex equipment can be used to screen for sleep apnea, the screening tests are often expensive, inconvenient for the patient, and time-consuming to be manually analysed. This research investigates methods for automating sleep apnea screening using low-cost off-body cameras. Polysomnography video recordings of twenty one patients, 11 with OSA, and 10 'normals' who were referred for suspected OSA, were analysed with the objective to differentiate the two groups. The proposed technique is based on motion estimation in videos using two successive video frames. The complexities of motion signals from the video data were analysed by calculating sample entropy over multiple time scales. The sample entropy values providing the best separation between the OSA and non-OSA groups were chosen using the Bhattacharyya distance and were then used as the input to a support vector machine classifier. The classification results both on the training and validation data indicate that patients with OSA can be differentiated from patients without OSA with 90\% accuracy.},

We report automated detection of common stereotypical motor movements using commercially available accelerometers affixed to the body and a generalizable detection algorithm. The method achieved a sensitivity of 80\% for body rocking and 93\% for hand flapping without individualized algorithm training or foreknowledge of subject’s specific movements. This approach is well-suited for implementation in a continuous monitoring system outside of a clinical setting.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

The code is provided under the new BSD licenseallowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has onlybeen under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved withexpanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices.MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets,helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility ofmethods by other researchers.

Based on ethnographic research in Guatemala, it is argued that neoliberalism’s cultural project entails pro-active recognition of a minimal package of cultural rights, and an equally vigorous rejection of the rest. The result is a dichotomy between recognised and recalcitrant indigenous subjects, which confronts the indigenous rights movement as a ‘ menace ’ even greater than the assimilationist policies of the previous era. It is suggested that the most effective response to this menace is probably not to engage in frontal opposition to neoliberal regimes, but rather to refuse the dichotomy altogether.},

An electronic referral application was implemented for Android smartphones and tablets which allowed the input, aggregation, and secure transmission of patient information that is currently collected on paper forms during surgical missions. The user interface and SMS text message-to-database feature allowed case management data to be entered and transmitted in real time. The referral application was piloted over a 3-day period with a collaborating NGO during a short-term surgical mission in rural Guatemala and was compared to the current standard-of-care paper medical record. This study also assessed the cell phone access and use of community attendees to identify the potential for communication with patients in an integrated electronic referral system. Participants in this study included nine medical mission staff members who used the referral application during the pilot, eight of whom took an end-user survey, 53 patients whose medical information was entered into the referral application, and 93 local attendees who participated in a community survey on cell phone usage. Overall, end-users expressed positive opinions of the application, which they found relatively easy to use. Data loss using the application was minimal in comparison to a 17\% permanent data loss of paper records, and the electronic medical records had high internal validity. Widespread cell phone use among community attendees suggests an opportunity to expand the referral application to further improve the surgical referral process.},

There are numerous approaches for measuring complexity in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental or medical diagnoses. Interventions, however, create the need for broader and deeper assessment—including the environments in which the young person lives. The Center for Discovery, New York state’s Center of Excellence for Developmental Disabilities, (TCFD) implemented an Assessment, Support, Education and Training (ASSET) grant from the New York Office for People with Developmental Disabilities. This paper will describe the Assessment activity. A major goal was to develop a tool for assessing the characteristics of the young person and pivotal environments. The objective was to promote the delay of or prevent movement to a more restrictive placement including residential placement. The pilot tool was developed over nine months and includes six areas for evaluation—medical/ impairments (8 items), functional profile (11 items), educational profile (5 items), home/family environment (9 items), school environment (6 items), and community environment (4 items). Implementation of CfD’s Inventory of Neuroeducational Complexity (INC) was able to distinguish among 30 pilot subjects those likely to use family and school interventions to maintain family living from those most likely needing at least short term residential placement. The INC is of substantial heuristic value in this time of great interest in effective and resourcefocused interventions with this population.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing timely and accurate information on the impact of the current pandemic on income and poverty to inform the targeting of resources to those most affected and assess the success of current efforts. We construct new measures of the income distribution and poverty with a lag of only a few weeks using high frequency data from the Basic Monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects income information for a large, representative sample of U.S. families. Because the family income data for this project are rarely used, we validate this timely measure of income by comparing historical estimates that rely on these data to estimates from data on income and consumption that have been used much more broadly. Our results indicate that at the start of the pandemic, government policy effectively countered its effects on incomes, leading poverty to fall and low percentiles of income to rise across a range of demographic groups and geographies. Simulations that rely on the detailed CPS data and that closely match total government payments made show that the entire decline in poverty that we find can be accounted for by the rise in government assistance, including unemployment insurance benefits and the Economic Impact Payments. Our simulations further indicate that of those losing employment the vast majority received unemployment insurance, though this was less true early on in the pandemic and receipt was uneven across the states, with some states not reaching a large share of their out of work residents.},

Prognostic models can provide standardised risk assessment to guide clinical management and can be vital to reduce and prevent maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of prognostic models for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes developed and/or validated in LMIC. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A systematic search in four databases (PubMed/ Medline, EMBASE, Global Health Library and The Cochrane Library) was conducted from inception (1970) up to 2 May 2018. Risk of bias was assessed with the PROBAST tool and narratively summarised. Results\hspace{0.6em} 1741 articles were screened and 21 prognostic models identified. Seventeen models focused on maternal outcomes and four on perinatal outcomes, of which hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (n=9) and perinatal death including stillbirth (n=4) was most reported. Only one model was externally validated. Thirty different predictors were used to develop the models. Risk of bias varied across studies, with the item ‘quality of analysis’ performing the least. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Prognostic models can be easy to use, informative and low cost with great potential to improve maternal and neonatal health in LMIC settings. However, the number of prognostic models developed or validated in LMIC settings is low and mirrors the 10/90 gap in which only 10\% of resources are dedicated to 90\% of the global disease burden. External validation of existing models developed in both LMIC and high-­income countries instead of developing new models should be encouraged.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems all over the world are struggling to manage the massive increase in emergency department (ED) visits. This has put an enormous demand on medical professionals. Increased wait times in the ED increases the risk of infection transmission. In this work we present an open-source, low cost, off-body system to assist in the automatic triage of patients in the ED based on widely available hardware. The system initially focuses on two symptoms of the infection - fever and cyanosis. The use of visible and far-infrared cameras allows for rapid assessment at a 1m distance, thus reducing the load on medical staff and lowering the risk of spreading the infection within hospitals. Its utility can be extended to a general clinical setting in non-emergency times as well to reduce wait time, channel the time and effort of healthcare professionals to more critical tasks and also prioritize severe cases. Our system consists of a Raspberry Pi 4, a Google Coral USB accelerator, a Raspberry Pi Camera v2 and a FLIR Lepton 3.5 Radiometry Long-Wave Infrared Camera with an associated IO module. Algorithms running in real-time detect the presence and body parts of individual(s) in view, and segments out the forehead and lip regions using PoseNet. The temperature of the forehead-eye area is estimated from the infrared camera image and cyanosis is assessed from the image of the lips in the visible spectrum. In our preliminary experiments, an accuracy of 97\% was achieved for detecting fever and 77\% for the detection of cyanosis, with a sensitivity of 91\% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. Although preliminary results are promising, we note that the entire system needs to be optimized before use and assessed for efficacy. The use of low-cost instrumentation will not produce temperature readings and identification of cyanosis that is acceptable in many situations. For this reason, we are releasing the full code stack and system design to allow others to rapidly iterate and improve the system. This may be of particular benefit in low-resource settings, and low-to-middle income countries in particular, which are just beginning to be affected by COVID-19.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the first experiment participants were randomly assigned to one of three interruptions: participants were given a complete rest (rest), participants completed an alphanumeric vigilance task (letter), or participants performed the primary vigilance task (continuous). In the second experiment participants were randomly assigned to one of the conditions from the first experiment or to two further conditions, in which participants (spatial memory) performed a spatial match to sample task, or participants (verbal memory) performed a letter match to sample task. Vigilance performance post-interruption was best for rest, worst for continuous, and varied for the other interruption tasks. Overall, the results suggest the vigilance decrement is due to the repeated use of particular executive resources, but there may, in addition be domain specific interference when the primary task and activities during a break make use of the same resources.},

Although everyone had the same job profile, we found large differences in how individuals reported stress levels, with similarity from day to day within the same participant, but large differences across the participants. We examined two ways to address the individual differences to automatically recognize classes of stressful/non-stressful calls, namely modifying the loss function of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to adapt to the varying priors, and giving more importance to training samples from the most similar people in terms of their skin conductance lability. We tested the methods on 1500 calls and achieved an accuracy across participants of 78.03\% when trained and tested on different days from the same person, and of 73.41\% when trained and tested on different people using the proposed adaptations to SVMs.},

We demonstrate an application of structural intersectionality using administrative data representing macrolevel structural racism, structural sexism, and income inequality in U.S. states linked to individual data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate multilevel models (N = 420,644 individuals nested in 76 state-years) investigating how intersecting dimensions of structural oppression shape health. Analyses show that these structural inequalities: (1) vary considerably across U.S. states, (2) intersect in numerous ways but do not strongly or positively covary, (3) individually and jointly shape health, and (4) are most consistently associated with poor health for black women. We conclude by outlining an agenda for future research on structural intersectionality and health.},

  abstract = {Background: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a network of health-related telephone surveys–conducted by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and participating US territories—that receive technical assistance from CDC. Data users often aggregate BRFSS state samples for national estimates without accounting for state-level sampling, a practice that could introduce bias because the weighted distributions of the state samples do not always adhere to national demographic distributions. Methods: This article examines six methods of reweighting, which are then compared with key health indicator estimates from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) based on 2013 data. Results: Compared to the usual stacking approach, all of the six new methods reduce the variance of weights and design effect at the national level, and some also reduce the estimated bias. This article also provides a comparison of the methods based on the variances induced by unequal weighting as well as the bias reduction induced by raking at the national level, and recommends a preferred method. Conclusions: The new method leads to weighted distributions that more accurately reproduce national demographic characteristics. While the empirical results for key estimates were limited to a few health indicators, they also suggest reduction in potential bias and mean squared error. To the extent that survey outcomes are associated with these demographic characteristics, matching the national distributions will reduce bias in estimates of these outcomes at the national level.},

The system was programmed to perform simple reaction time trials and was tested with ten volunteers during 8 h of their normal daytime activities. Results indicate that the volunteers responded properly to most of the interrogations (¿95\%) and that the impact of the device on everyday activities was not significant. The ability to assess cognitive capabilities of individuals continuously during everyday activities could have far-reaching implications for diagnostics and treatment of many different neurological conditions.},

  abstract = {Dynamic reconfiguration of the human brain is characterized by the nature of complexity. The purpose of this study was to measure such complexity and also analyze its association with age. We modeled the dynamic reconfiguration process by dynamic functional connectivity, which was established by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and we measured complexity within the dynamic functional connectivity by sample entropy (SampEn). A brainwide map of SampEn in healthy subjects shows larger values in the caudate, the olfactory gyrus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, and lower values in primary sensorimotor and visual areas. Association analysis in healthy subjects indicated that SampEn of the amygdala-cortical connectivity decreases with advancing age. Such age-related loss of SampEn, however, disappears in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that SampEn of the dynamic functional connectivity is a promising indicator of normal aging.},

  abstract = {Chitin nanofibrils are prepared by treatment of commercial chitin in hydrochloric acid. It is found for the first time that the obtained chitin nanofibrils can be well dispersed in an organic solvent of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) due to its strong ability to form hydrogen bonds. Polycaprolactone (PCL), a water insoluble biodegradable polymer, is selected to blend with chitin nanofibrils to achieve chitin nanofibril/polycaprolactone (n-chitin/PCL) nanocomposites using TFE as a co-solvent. The results show the n-chitin/PCL nanocomposites, either in the form of solvent-cast films or electrospun fiber mats, both exhibit reinforced mechanical properties. Thus, the processing technique from a TFE suspension instead of aqueous suspensions is a good alternative to broaden the family of chitin nanofibril-based nanocomposites.},

The questionnaire aims to assess cognitive decline independent of pre-morbid ability. In the present study, the IQCODE was administered to a sample of 613 informants from the general population. In addition, the questionnaire was administered to informants of 309 dementing subjects who had filled it out one year previously. A principal components analysis, using the general population sample, confirmed that the IQCODE measures a general factor of cognitive decline. The questionnaire was found to have high internal reliability in the general population sample (alpha = 0·95) and reasonably high test-retest reliability over one year in the dementing sample (               r               = 0·75). The total IQCODE score, as well as each of the 26-items, was found to discriminate well between the general population and dementing samples. The correlation with education was quite small (               r               = – 0·13), indicating that contamination by premorbid ability is not a problem.},

Browning intensity, surface free energy components, mechanical properties, thermal attributes, electrical performance, water vapor permeability (WVP), solvent interaction behavior and antimicrobial activity were evaluated. The Maillard reaction product of CFG:CH showed shear thinning behavior. The enhancement in the dispersive components of surface free energy indicated Maillard reaction created water resistance in the films. The films were mechanically strong and flexible. The physicochemical descriptors reflected Maillard reaction produces strong interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) that leads to production of films resistant to water, acids and alkali. This was also observed in SEM analysis. In addition, the enhancement in zones of inhibition suggested antibacterial activity of Maillard reaction product. Overall, the films (F21) produced via Maillard reaction “in situ” were tough, flexible, water resistant and antimicrobial in nature. Thus, suggested high potential of these IPN films in food and pharmaceuticals.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has risen significantly in the last ten years, and today, roughly 1 in 68 children has been diagnosed. One hallmark set of symptoms in this disorder are stereotypical motor movements. These repetitive movements may include spinning, body-rocking, or hand-flapping, amongst others. Despite the growing number of individuals affected by autism, an effective, accurate method of automatically quantifying such movements remains unavailable. This has negative implications for assessing the outcome of ASD intervention and drug studies. Here we present a novel approach to detecting autistic symptoms using the Microsoft Kinect v.2 to objectively and automatically quantify autistic body movements. The Kinect camera was used to film 12 actors performing three separate stereotypical motor movements each. Visual Gesture Builder (VGB) was implemented to analyze the skeletal structures in these recordings using a machine learning approach. In addition, movement detection was hard-coded in Matlab. Manual grading was used to confirm the validity and reliability of VGB and Matlab analysis. We found that both methods were able to detect autistic body movements with high probability. The machine learning approach yielded highest detection rates, supporting its use in automatically quantifying complex autistic behaviors with multi-dimensional input.},

It has been a puzzle in part due to difficulty in identifying its basic, fundamental components. Several studies have shown that some manifestations of schizophrenia (e.g., the negative symptoms that include blunting of speech prosody, as well as the disorganization symptoms that lead to disordered language) can be understood from the perspective of linguistics. However, schizophrenia research has not kept pace with technologies in computational linguistics, especially in semantics and pragmatics. As such, we examine the writings of schizophrenia patients analyzing their syntax, semantics and pragmatics. In addition, we analyze tweets of (self proclaimed) schizophrenia patients who publicly discuss their diagnoses. For writing samples dataset, syntactic features are found to be the most successful in classification whereas for the less structured Twitter dataset, a combination of features performed the best.},

Survival models, e.g. the Cox proportional hazards model, can potentially improve this situation by predicting individuals' levels of need, which can then be used to prioritize the waiting lists. Providing care to those in need can prevent institutionalization for those individuals, which both improves quality of life and reduces overall costs. While the benefits of such an approach are clear, care must be taken to ensure that the prioritization process is fair or independent of demographic information-based harmful stereotypes. In this work, we develop multiple fairness definitions for survival models and corresponding fair Cox proportional hazards models to ensure equitable allocation of healthcare resources. We demonstrate the utility of our methods in terms of fairness and predictive accuracy on two publicly available survival datasets.},

  abstract = {"Epidemiology is often referred to as the science of public health. However, unlike other major sciences, its theoretical foundations are rarely articulated. While the idea of epidemiologic theory may seem dry and arcane, it is at its core about explaining the people's health. It is about life and death. It is about biology and society. It is about ecology and the economy. It is about how myriad aspects of people's lives--involving work, dignity, desire, love, play, conflict, discrimination, and injustice--become literally incorporated biologically into our bodies and manifest in our health status, individually and collectively. And it is about essential knowledge critical for improving the people's health and minimizing inequitable burdens of disease, disability, and death. Woven from a vast array of schools of thought, including those in the natural, social, and biomedical sciences, epidemiologic theory is a rich tapestry whose time for analysis is long overdue. By tracing its history and contours from ancient societies on through the development of--and debates within--contemporary epidemiology worldwide, Nancy Krieger shows how epidemiologic theory has long shaped epidemiologic practice, knowledge, and the politics of public health. Outlining an ecosocial theory of disease distribution that situates both population health and epidemiologic theory in societal and ecologic context, she offers a more holistic picture of how we embody the human experience"--Provided by publisher},

This study examines correlations between Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) ratings and actigraphic measures of daytime activity. The aim of this study is to determine the value of ambulatory actigraphy in the assessment of locomotor deficits as a correlate of apathy in geriatric patients with cognitive impairment. Patients and methods: In this cross-sectional study a total of 82 participants were recruited, 32 patients with dementia, 21 patients with MCI and 23 elderly controls. Rating scales for apathy (AES) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI) were completed. To measure daytime activity a wrist-worn actigraph and an established protocol were used. A single measure of mean daytime activity per participant was calculated for further statistical analysis. Results: In the two groups of patients with MCI and dementia, apathy is associated with reduced daytime activity, independent of diagnosis (no group by apathy interaction). AES scores correlate significantly with daytime activity. Cognitive impairment reduces daytime activity (effect greater in dementia than in MCI). Daytime activity is negatively correlated with memory deficits. Conclusion: Ambulatory actigraphy is a promising method to evaluate self-initiated action as a correlate of apathy in patients with cognitive impairment. ß 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Objective: To describe COVID-19 outcomes among people with IDD living in residential groups homes in the state of New York and the general population of New York State. Methods: Data for people with IDD are from a coalition of organizations providing over half of the residential services for the state of New York, and from the New York State Department of Health. Analysis describes COVID-19 case rates, case-fatality, and mortality among people with IDD living in residential group homes and New York State through May 28, 2020. Results: People with IDD living in residential group homes were at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes: case rates e 7,841 per 100,000 for people with IDD compared to 1,910 for New York State; case-fatality e 15.0\% for people with IDD compared to 7.9\% for New York State; and mortality rate e 1,175 per 100,000 for people with IDD compared to 151 per 100,000 for New York State. Differences in cases and mortality rate were confirmed across regions of the state, but case-fatality rate was only higher for people with IDD in and around the New York City region. Conclusions: COVID-19 appears to present a greater risk to people with IDD, especially those living in congregate settings. A full understanding of the severity of this risk will not be possible until US states begin publicly sharing all relevant data they have on COVID-19 outcomes among this population.},

  abstract = {Like many groups considering the new programming language Julia, we faced the challenge of accessing the algorithms that we develop in Julia from R. Therefore, we developed the R package JuliaConnectoR, available from the CRAN repository and GitHub (https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR), in particular for making advanced deep learning tools available. For maintainability and stability, we decided to base communication between R and Julia on TCP, using an optimized binary format for exchanging data. Our package also specifically contains features that allow for a convenient interactive use in R. This makes it easy to develop R extensions with Julia or to simply call functionality from Julia packages in R. Interacting with Julia objects and calling Julia functions becomes user-friendly, as Julia functions and variables are made directly available as objects in the R workspace. We illustrate the further features of our package with code examples, and also discuss advantages over the two alternative packages JuliaCall and XRJulia. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the package with a more extensive example for employing neural ordinary differential equations, a recent deep learning technique that has received much attention. This example also provides more general guidance for integrating deep learning techniques from Julia into R.},

Participants included 198\,540 high school students.Across all sex and race and ethnic groups, there were significant linear decreases in self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide plans from 1991 to 2017. Female adolescents (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; P \&lt; .001) had significant decreases in attempts over time. Black adolescents had positive linear trends for suicide attempts among both boys (OR, 1.04; P \&lt; .001) and girls (OR, 1.02; P = .003). Black adolescent boys (OR, 1.04; P = .048) had a significant linear increase in injury by attempt.The results suggest that, over time, black youth have experienced an increase in suicide attempts, which is troubling because attempts are the most prominent risk factor associated with suicide death. For black boys, a significant increase in injury by attempt occurred, which suggests that black boys may be engaging in increasingly lethal means when attempting suicide. Examining trends of suicidal thoughts and behaviors over time by sex and race and ethnicity allow us to determine where to focus prevention and intervention efforts. Future research should examine the underlying reasons for these changes observed in US high school students.},

Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

  abstract = {A common barrier to healthcare for psychiatric conditions is the stigma associated with these disorders. Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members, preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, research shows (increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example, service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA, which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members, we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a yearlong deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA. A second, larger sample of active-duty and former service members found a similar effect that approached statistical significance. Because respondents in both studies shared more with virtual human interviewers than an anonymized PDHA—even though both conditions control for stigma and ramifications for service members’ military records—virtual human interviewers that build rapport may provide a superior option to encourage reporting.},

  abstract = {We describe a method for proactive information retrieval targeted at retrieving relevant information during a writing task. In our method, the current task and the needs of the user are estimated, and the potential next steps are unobtrusively predicted based on the user’s past actions. We focus on the task of writing, in which the user is coalescing previously collected information into a text. Our proactive system automatically recommends the user relevant background information. The proposed system incorporates text input prediction using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We present simulations, which show that the system is able to reach higher precision values in an exploratory search setting compared to both a baseline and a comparison system.},

Objectives: To review definitions publicly available for RWD to shed light on similarities and differences between them. Methods: A literature review and stakeholder interviews were used to compile data from eight groups of stakeholders. Data from documents and interviews were subjected to coding analysis. Definitions identified were classified into four categories: 1) data collected in a non-randomized controlled trial setting, 2) data collected in a non-interventional/ non-controlled setting, 3) data collected in a non-experimental setting, and 4) others (i.e., data that do not fit into the other three categories). The frequency of definitions identified per category was recorded. Results: Fifty-three documents and 20 interviews were assessed. Thirty-eight definitions were identified: 20 out of 38 definitions (53\%) were category 1 definitions, 9 (24\%) were category 2 definitions, 5 (13\%) were category 3 definitions, and 4 (11\%) were category 4 definitions. Differences were identified between, and within, definition categories.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SAIL, a Single Access Point Based Indoor Localization system. Although there have been advances in WiFi-based positioning techniques, we find that existing solutions either require a dense deployment of access points (APs), manual fingerprinting, energy hungry WiFi scanning, or sophisticated AP hardware. We design SAIL using a single commodity WiFi AP to avoid these restrictions. SAIL computes the distance between the client and an AP using the propagation delay of the signal traversing between the two, combines the distance with smartphone dead-reckoning techniques, and employs geometric methods to ultimately yield the client’s location using a single AP. SAIL combines physical layer (PHY) information and human motion to compute the propagation delay of the direct path by itself, eliminating the adverse effect of multipath and yielding sub-meter distance estimation accuracy. Furthermore, SAIL systematically addresses some of the common challenges towards dead-reckoning using smartphone sensors and achieves 2 − 5x accuracy improvements over existing techniques. We have implemented SAIL on commodity wireless APs and smartphones. Evaluation in a large-scale enterprise environment with 10 mobile users demonstrates that SAIL can capture the user’s location with a mean error of 2.3m using just a single AP.},

In particular, the smartphone offers the opportunity to provide augmented or procedural information through active audiovisual aids to illiterate or untrained users, as described in this article. In this article, the process of refinement and iterative design of a smartphone application prototype to support perinatal surveillance in rural Guatemala for indigenous Maya lay midwives with low levels of literacy and technology exposure is described. Following on from a pilot to investigate the feasibility of this system, a two-year project to develop a robust in-field system was initiated, culminating in a randomized controlled trial of the system, which is ongoing.},

  abstract = {Background/objective: Guatemala’s indigenous Maya population has one of the highest perinatal and maternal mortality rates in Latin America. In this population most births are delivered at home by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who have limited support and linkages to public hospitals. The goal of this study was to characterize the detection of maternal and perinatal complications and rates of facility-level referral by TBAs, and to evaluate the impact of a mHealth decision support system on these rates. Methods: A pragmatic one-year feasibility trial of an mHealth decisions support system was conducted in rural Maya communities in collaboration with TBAs. TBAs were individually randomized in an unblinded fashion to either early-access or later-access to the mHealth system. TBAs in the early-access arm used the mHealth system throughout the study. TBAs in the later-access arm provided usual care until crossing over uni-directionally to the mHealth system at the study midpoint. The primary study outcome was the monthly rate of referral to facility-level care, adjusted for birth volume. Results: Forty-four TBAs were randomized, 23 to the early-access arm and 21 to the later-access arm. Outcomes were analyzed for 799 pregnancies (early-access 425, later-access 374). Monthly referral rates to facility-level care were significantly higher among the early-access arm (median 33 referrals per 100 births, IQR 22–58) compared to the later-access arm (median 20 per 100, IQR 0–30) (p = 0.03). At the study midpoint, the later-access arm began using the mHealth platform and its referral rates increased (median 34 referrals per 100 births, IQR 5–50) with no significant difference from the early-access arm (p = 0.58). Rates of complications were similar in both arms, except for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which were significantly higher among TBAs in the early-access arm (RR 3.3, 95\% CI 1.10–9.86). Conclusions: Referral rates were higher when TBAs had access to the mHealth platform. The introduction of mHealth supportive technologies for TBAs is feasible and can improve detection of complications and timely referral to facility-care within challenging healthcare delivery contexts.

  abstract = {Governmental-contracting of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is a central strategy of neoliberal health reforms in Central America. More than improving the equity, efficiency, and quality of health services, contracting presents a potential mechanism to redefine antagonistic relationships between the state and civil society, particularly in countries ravaged by political violence. In this paper I examine the process of heath reform in Guatemala through the implementation of the Sistema Integral de Atencio´n en Salud (SIAS) in the municipality of San Martı´n Jilotepeque. Mandated in the 1996 Peace Accords, SIAS potentially facilitates decentralization and civil participation through governmental-contracting of NGOs to provide health services to underserved populations. Drawing on ethnographic interviews with NGO representatives, Ministry of Health (MOH) workers, and community health workers and midwives, I examine the contracting process and then address issues of equity, efficiency, and quality of services, as well as the process of decentralization. I argue that contracted NGOs are largely restricted to serve as administrators, removed from the delivery of services, and are heavily dependent upon the traditional MOH structure, which limits the ability of SIAS to improve health services or foster the processes of decentralization and democratization.},

These mediators of the stress response promote adaptation in the aftermath of acute stress, but they also contribute to allostatic overload, the wear and tear on the body and brain that result from being “stressed out.” This conceptual framework has created a need to know how to improve the efficiency of the adaptive response to stressors while minimizing overactivity of the same systems, since such overactivity results in many of the common diseases of modern life. This framework has also helped to demystify the biology of stress by emphasizing the protective as well as the damaging effects of the body's attempts to cope with the challenges known as stressors.},

  abstract = {Whereas people learn many different types of knowledge from diverse experiences over many years, and become ­better learners over time, most current machine learning systems are much more narrow, learning just a single function or data model based on statistical analysis of a single data set. We suggest that people learn better than computers precisely because of this difference, and we suggest a key direction for machine learning research is to develop software architectures that enable intelligent agents to also learn many types of knowledge, continuously over many years, and to become better learners over time. In this paper we define more precisely this never-ending learning paradigm for machine learning, and we present one case study: the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL), which achieves a number of the desired properties of a never-ending learner. NELL has been learning to read the Web 24hrs/ day since January 2010, and so far has acquired a knowledge base with 120mn diverse, confidence-weighted beliefs (e.g., servedWith(tea,biscuits)), while learning thousands of interrelated functions that continually improve its reading competence over time. NELL has also learned to reason over its knowledge base to infer new beliefs it has not yet read from those it has, and NELL is inventing new relational predicates to extend the ontology it uses to represent beliefs. We describe the design of NELL, experimental results illustrating its behavior, and discuss both its successes and shortcomings as a case study in never-ending learning. NELL can be tracked online at http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu, and followed on Twitter at @CMUNELL.},

States and territories that issued mandatory stay-at-home orders experienced decreased population movement in most counties. The period after the first state relaxed a stay-at-home order was associated with increased population movement in states or territories that had not relaxed a stay-at-home order in the same period. What are the implications for public health practice? Stay-at-home orders can reduce activities associated with community spread of COVID-19, including population movement and close person-to-person contact outside the household. These findings can inform future public policies to reduce community spread of COVID-19.},

The study focuses on elders coping with cognitive decline and their caregivers, but it is expected that the concepts will have much broader applicability. Social needs and barriers were examined in a qualitative study of 45 households across the U.S. Directions for ubiquitous computing concepts are outlined to address these social needs and barriers. Two example concepts, an ambient display to facilitate joint activity and a social memory aid, are described in detail. An underlying principal of these design directions and concepts is the use of computing technologies as catalysts rather than substitutes for human relationships. These concepts are part of an integrated system of home health technologies under development in a multiyear “aging in place” study.},

Here we model the effect of evictions on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, simulating viral transmission within and among households in a theoretical metropolitan area. We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess eviction moratoria and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control.},

  abstract = {The effects of gamma irradiation on chitosan samples were determined in terms of physicochemical and functional properties. Shrimp chitosan was extracted from shell using a chemical process involving demineralization, deproteinization, decolorization and deacetylation. Commercial snow chitosan was also used. Samples (in a solid state) were given irradiation dose of 25kGy at a dose rate of 1.1013kGy/h in air and 0kGy samples were used as controls. Results showed that moisture contents were between 8.690\% and 13.645\%. There were no significant differences (P{$>$}0.05) in the degree of deacetylation of the chitosan samples. Significant differences (P{$<$}0.05) were observed in the viscosity and viscosity-average molecular weight of the chistosan samples. Viscosity and molecular weight decreased when the samples were given the irradiation dose of 25kGy. Chitosan samples had low antioxidant activity compared with BHT. Water binding capacity ranged from 582.40\% to 656.75\% and fat binding capacity was between 431.00\% and 560.55\%. Irradiation had a major effect on the viscosity and the viscosity-average molecular weight of the chitosan samples.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent telehealth studies have demonstrated minor impact on patients affected by long-term conditions. The use of technology does not guarantee the compliance required for sustained collection of high-quality symptom and physiological data. Remote monitoring alone is not sufficient for successful disease management. A patient-centred design approach is needed in order to allow the personalisation of interventions and encourage the completion of daily self-management tasks. Methods: A digital health system was designed to support patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in self-managing their condition. The system includes a mobile application running on a consumer tablet personal computer and a secure backend server accessible to the health professionals in charge of patient management. The patient daily routine included the completion of an adaptive, electronic symptom diary on the tablet, and the measurement of oxygen saturation via a wireless pulse oximeter. Results: The design of the system was based on a patient-centred design approach, informed by patient workshops. One hundred and ten patients in the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial were subsequently given the tablet computer and pulse oximeter for a 12-month period. Patients were encouraged, but not mandated, to use the digital health system daily. The average used was 6.0 times a week by all those who participated in the full trial. Three months after enrolment, patients were able to complete their symptom diary and oxygen saturation measurement in less than 1 m 40s (96\% of symptom diaries). Custom algorithms, based on the self-monitoring data collected during the first 50 days of use, were developed to personalise alert thresholds. Conclusions: Strategies and tools aimed at refining a digital health intervention require iterative use to enable convergence on an optimal, usable design. ‘Continuous improvement’ allowed feedback from users to have an immediate impact on the design of the system (e.g., collection of quality data), resulting in high compliance with self-monitoring over a prolonged period of time (12-month). Health professionals were prompted by prioritisation algorithms to review patient data, which led to their regular use of the remote monitoring website throughout the trial. Trial registration: Trial registration: ISRCTN40367841. Registered 17/10/2012.},

Typically, it is based mostly on self-reports or observations, and hardly ever upon actigraphy. Other signals related to physiology are rarely used, despite the fact that the autonomic nervous system is often affected by mental disorders. Aim: This study attempted to fuse physiological and physical activity data and discover features that are predictive for schizophrenia. Method: Continuous simultaneous heart rate (HR) and physical activity recordings were made on 16 individuals with schizophrenia and 19 healthy controls. Statistical characteristics of the recorded data were analyzed, as well as non-linear rest–activity measures and disorganization measures. Results: Four most predictive features for schizophrenia were identified, namely, the standard deviation and mode of locomotor activity, dynamics of Multiscale Entropy change over scales of HR signal and the mean HR. A classifier trained on these features provided a cross-validation accuracy of 95.3\% (AUC ¼ 0.99) for differentiating between schizophrenia patients and controls, compared to 78.5 and 85.5\% accuracy (AUC ¼ 0.85 and AUC ¼ 0.90) using only the HR or locomotor activity features. Conclusion: Physiological and physical activity signals provide complimentary information for assessment of mental health.},

Though historically these behaviors were relegated to the fringes of communities, information technology now enables new ways to foster and encourage these dangerous activities. This paper defines the concept of digital selfharm as the online communication and activity that leads to, supports, or exacerbates, non-suicidal yet intentional harm or impairment of an individual’s physical wellbeing. We outline a research agenda for the CSCW community to understand the correlation and possible causation of offline self-harm behaviors due to online activities, and to design and assess technologies focused on prevention, mitigation and treatment. CAUTION: This paper includes media that could potentially be triggering to those dealing with an eating disorder or with other self-harm related illnesses.

For instance, graphs are functors to \$\textbackslash mathsf\{C\}\$ from the category with two parallel arrows. Such functors are known informally as \$\textbackslash mathsf\{C\}\$-sets. In this paper, we describe and implement an extension of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{C\}\$-sets having data attributes with fixed types, such as graphs with labeled vertices or real-valued edge weights. We call such structures "acsets," short for "attributed \$\textbackslash mathsf\{C\}\$-sets." Derived from previous work on algebraic databases, acsets are a joint generalization of graphs and data frames. They also encompass more elaborate graph-like objects such as wiring diagrams and Petri nets with rate constants. We develop the mathematical theory of acsets and then describe a generic implementation in the Julia programming language, which uses advanced language features to achieve performance comparable with specialized data structures.},

What might sound like a reasonable dictum metastasized in the twentieth century into one of science's biggest obstacles, as a legion of researchers became unwilling to make the claim that one thing could cause another. Even two decades ago, asking a statistician a question like "Was it the aspirin that stopped my headache?" would have been like asking if he believed in voodoo, or at best a topic for conversation at a cocktail party rather than a legitimate target of scientific inquiry. Scientists were allowed to posit only that the probability that one thing was associated with another.

  abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents a comprehensive theory of causality which unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and offers simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book opens the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 2,800 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers’ questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

Just as the construct of dementia has been refined over the years to reflect increasing sophistication in diagnostic skill, so has the characterization of MCI been refined. If the approach to classifying the syndrome of MCI into multiple subtypes is combined with the presumed etiology, much of the variability in the literature can be resolved.},

One challenge is that emotional arousal, when measured as sympathetic nervous system activation through electrodermal activity, can sometimes differ significantly across the two halves of the upper body. We show that traditional measures on only one side may lead to misjudgment of arousal. This article presents daily life and controlled study data, as well as existing evidence from neuroscience, supporting the influence of multiple emotional substrates in the brain causing innervation on different sides of the body. We describe how a theory of multiple arousals explains the asymmetric EDA findings.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years response rates on telephone surveys have been declining. Rates for the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS) have also declined, prompting the use of new methods of weighting and the inclusion of cell phone sampling frames. A number of scholars and researchers have conducted studies of the reliability and validity of the BRFSS estimates in the context of these changes. As the BRFSS makes changes in its methods of sampling and weighting, a review of reliability and validity studies of the BRFSS is needed. Methods: In order to assess the reliability and validity of prevalence estimates taken from the BRFSS, scholarship published from 2004–2011 dealing with tests of reliability and validity of BRFSS measures was compiled and presented by topics of health risk behavior. Assessments of the quality of each publication were undertaken using a categorical rubric. Higher rankings were achieved by authors who conducted reliability tests using repeated test/ retest measures, or who conducted tests using multiple samples. A similar rubric was used to rank validity assessments. Validity tests which compared the BRFSS to physical measures were ranked higher than those comparing the BRFSS to other self-reported data. Literature which undertook more sophisticated statistical comparisons was also ranked higher. Results: Overall findings indicated that BRFSS prevalence rates were comparable to other national surveys which rely on self-reports, although specific differences are noted for some categories of response. BRFSS prevalence rates were less similar to surveys which utilize physical measures in addition to self-reported data. There is very little research on reliability and validity for some health topics, but a great deal of information supporting the validity of the BRFSS data for others. Conclusions: Limitations of the examination of the BRFSS were due to question differences among surveys used as comparisons, as well as mode of data collection differences. As the BRFSS moves to incorporating cell phone data and changing weighting methods, a review of reliability and validity research indicated that past BRFSS landline only data were reliable and valid as measured against other surveys. New analyses and comparisons of BRFSS data which include the new methodologies and cell phone data will be needed to ascertain the impact of these changes on estimates in the future.},

  author = {Quigley, Jody and Rasmussen, Susan and Mcalaney, John},
  date = {2014-04-24},
  abstract = {Introduction: A systematic review of 86 papers revealed that adolescents’ suicidal and self-harming behaviour is positively associated with similar behaviours in people they know. Social norms research into other damaging health behaviours suggests that one’s engagement in a given behaviour is related to perceived social norms surrounding that behaviour, but social norms are often misperceived, such that it may be those misperceptions which are related to behaviour. Interventions which reduce such misperceptions have proven effective in reducing those behaviours. The current study aimed to address the dearth of research into the role of social norms regarding suicidal and self-harming behaviours. Method: 184 undergraduates completed an anonymous, online self-report survey exploring their engagement in, and approval of, suicidal and self-harming behaviours, and their perceptions of others’ engagement in (descriptive norms), and approval of (injunctive norms), those behaviours. Results: Consistent with previous social norms research, participants tended to overestimate the descriptive norms of suicidal and self-harming behaviours for less familiar groups (e.g. “students in general”) relative to their own. However, contrary to previous research, they also tended to underestimate descriptive norms for those closer to them (e.g. “your siblings”). No differences were found with regard to injunctive norms. Conclusions: Results suggest that The Social Norms Approach, which has been used in other areas to correct misperceptions and reduce target behaviours, may be applicable to suicidal and self-harming behaviours, but only in terms of descriptive norms. Further research is underway to explore the unexpected findings.}

Even though disease severity scores are not the key elements of treatment, they are however, an essential part of improvement in clinical decisions and in identifying patients with unexpected outcomes. Prediction models do face many challenges, but, proper application of these models helps in decision making at the right time and in decreasing hospital cost. In fact, they have become a necessary tool to describe ICU populations and to explain differences in mortality. However, it is also important to note that the choice of the severity score scale, index, or model should accurately match the event, setting or application; as mis-application, of such systems can lead to wastage of time, increased cost, unwarranted extrapolations and poor science.This article provides a brief overview of ICU severity scales (along with their predicted death/survival rate calculations) developed over the last 3 decades including several of them which has been revised accordingly.},

A separate processing step ensures that only a minimal but sufficient number of headshoulder candidates is evaluated. This contributes to an excellent runtime performance. A final tracking step reliably propagates detections in time and provides stable tracking results. The quality of the presented method allows us to recognize many challenging situations with humans tailgating and piggybacking.},

  abstract = {Objective Schizophrenia has been associated with changes in heart rate (HR) and physical activity measures. However, the relationship between analysis window length and classifier accuracy using these features has yet to be quantified. Approach Here we used objective HR and activity data to classify contiguous days of data as belonging to a schizophrenia patient or a healthy control. HR and physical activity recordings were made on 12 medicated subjects with schizophrenia and 12 healthy controls. Features derived from these data included classical statistical characteristics, rest-activity metrics, transfer entropy, and multiscale fuzzy entropy. We varied the analysis window length from two to eight days, and selected features via minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance. A support vector machine was trained to classify schizophrenia from control windows on a daily basis. Model performance was assessed via subject-wise leave-one-out-crossfold-validation. Main results An analysis window length of eight days resulted in an area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96. Reducing the analysis window length to two days only lowered the AUC to 0.91. The type of most predictive features varied with analysis window length. Significance Our results suggest continuous tracking of subjects with schizophrenia over short time scales may be sufficient to estimate illness severity on a daily basis.},

These signals can be passively monitored using sensors in smartphones, wearable accelerometers, Holter monitors, and multimodal sensing approaches that fuse multiple data types. Connection of these devices to the internet has made large scale studies feasible and is enabling a revolution in neuropsychiatric monitoring. Currently, evaluation and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders relies on clinical visits, which are infrequent and out of the context of a patient’s home environment. Moreover, the demand for clinical care far exceeds the supply of providers. The growing prevalence of context-aware and physiologically relevant digital sensors in consumer technology could help address these challenges, enable objective indexing of patient severity, and inform rapid adjustment of treatment in real-time. Here we review recent studies utilizing such sensors in the context of neuropsychiatric illnesses including stress and depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.},

Method Gait analysis records were retrospectively reviewed for ambulatory patients with CP. Gait abnormalities were identified using physical exam and kinematic data. Relationships among age, sex, previous surgery, GMFCS level, and prevalence of gait abnormalities associated with crouch and out-toeing, and equinus and in-toeing were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results One-thousand and five records were reviewed. The most common gait problems were in-toeing, excessive knee flexion, stiff knee, hip flexion, internal rotation, adduction, and equinus (all {$>$}50\%). Odds ratios (OR) for various gait problems associated with crouch and out-toeing increased (OR 1.07–1.32), and those associated with equinus and in-toeing decreased (OR 0.80–0.94) significantly with increasing age for patients in GMFCS levels I to III. The same trends were seen with prior surgery (OR for crouch and out-toeing: 1.86–7.14; OR for equinus and in-toeing: 0.16–0.59). Interpretation The prevalence of gait abnormalities varies by GMFCS level, but similarities exist among levels. The study results suggest that in younger children, particularly those in GMFCS levels III and IV, treatments for equinus and in-toeing should be undertaken with caution because these problems tend to decrease with age even without orthopedic intervention. Such children may end up with the ‘opposite’ deformities of calcaneal crouch and out-toeing, which tend to increase in prevalence with age.},

  abstract = {We conduct a statistical study of human mobility using over 1000 hours of GPS traces of human walks involving 44 participants in five different locations, two university campuses, state fair, New York City, and Disney World. Our data reveals statistical features similar to those in what physicists have long called Levy random walks (or Levy walks). These features include heavy-tail distributions of flight lengths and super-diffusive nature of mobility. We find that these tendencies are likely caused by human intentions in deciding travel destinations (and distance and sojourn time thereof), but not by geographical constraints such as roads, buildings, boundaries, etc, and that geographical constraints, instead, cause truncations of flight lengths and discontinuity in the statistical tendency of mobility statistics. Based on these findings, we construct a simple Levy walk mobility model that emulates human walk patterns expected in outdoor mobile networks carried by humans. Based on these findings, we construct a simple Levy walk mobility model that emulates human walk patterns expected in outdoor mobile network environments. We demonstrate that the Levy walk model can be used to recreate the statistical patterns commonly observed in previous mobility studies such as the power-law distributions of human inter-contact times and that the simulation performance of mobile network routing protocols under the Levy walk model exhibits distinctive performance features unexplored under existing mobility models.},

  abstract = {Objective To estimate the percentage reduction in incidence of dementia that would be obtained if specific risk factors were eliminated. Design Prospective seven year cohort study. Setting General population, Montpellier, France. Participants 1433 people aged over 65 with a mean baseline age of 72.5 (SD 5.1) years. Main outcome measures Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia established by a standardised neurological examination. Results Cox models were constructed to derive hazard ratios and determine confounding and interaction effects for potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Mean percentage population attributable fractions were calculated with 95\% confidence intervals derived from bootstrapping for seven year incidence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The final model retained crystallised intelligence (population attributable fraction 18.11\%, 95\% confidence interval 10.91\% to 25.42\%), depression (10.31\%, 3.66\% to 17.17\%), fruit and vegetable consumption (6.46\%, 0.15\% to 13.06\%), diabetes (4.88\%, 1.87\% to 7.98\%), and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (7.11\%, 2.44\% to 11.98\%). Conclusions Increasing crystallised intelligence and fruit and vegetable consumption and eliminating depression and diabetes are likely to have the biggest impact on reducing the incidence of dementia, outweighing even the effect of removing the principal known genetic risk factor. Although causal relations cannot be concluded with certainty, the study suggests priorities that may inform public health programmes.},

  abstract = {Lack of surgical care has been highlighted as a critical global health problem, and short-term medical missions (STMMs) have become a de facto measure to address this shortfall. Participation in STMMs is an increasingly popular activity for foreign medical professionals to undertake in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where their clinical skills may be in short supply. While there is emerging literature on the STMM phenomenon, patient experiences of surgical missions are underrepresented. This research addresses this gap through thirtyseven in-depth interviews with patients or caregivers who received care from a short-term surgical mission within the three years prior to the four-week data collection period in July and August 2013. Interviews were conducted in Antigua, Guatemala and nearby communities, and participants came from 9 different departments of the country. These first-hand accounts of health-seeking through a surgical mission provide important insights into the benefits and challenges of STMMs that patients encounter, including waiting time, ancillary costs, and access to care. Patient agency in care-seeking is considered within the pluralistic, privatized health care context in Guatemala in which foreign participants deliver STMM care.},

  abstract = {Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality. This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

  abstract = {The Wilcoxon signed rank test is a frequently used nonparametric test for paired data (e.g., consisting of pre- and posttreatment measurements) based on independent units of analysis. This test cannot be used for paired comparisons arising from clustered data (e.g., if paired comparisons are available for each of two eyes of an individual). To incorporate clustering, a generalization of the randomization test formulation for the signed rank test is proposed, where the unit of randomization is at the cluster level (e.g., person), while the individual paired units of analysis are at the subunit within cluster level (e.g., eye within person). An adjusted variance estimate of the signed rank test statistic is then derived, which can be used for either balanced (same number of subunits per cluster) or unbalanced (different number of subunits per cluster) data, with an exchangeable correlation structure, with or without tied values. The resulting test statistic is shown to be asymptotically normal as the number of clusters becomes large, if the cluster size is bounded. Simulation studies are performed based on simulating correlated ranked data from a signed log-normal distribution. These studies indicate appropriate type I error for data sets with ≥20 clusters and a superior power profile compared with either the ordinary signed rank test based on the average cluster difference score or the multivariate signed rank test of Puri and Sen (1971, Nonparametric Methods in Multivariate Analysis, New York: John Wiley). Finally, the methods are illustrated with two data sets, (i) an ophthalmologic data set involving a comparison of electroretinogram (ERG) data in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients before and after undergoing an experimental surgical procedure, and (ii) a nutritional data set based on a randomized prospective study of nutritional supplements in RP patients where vitamin E intake outside of study capsules is compared before and after randomization to monitor compliance with nutritional protocols.},

In study 1, we examined the decrement in a visual line-length discrimination task employed in previous research. The task had a linear decrement in perceptual sensitivity with time-on-task based on the results of a trend analysis (orthogonal polynomial contrasts). In addition, the task had a profile of self-reported stress and workload similar to other moderately demanding vigilance tasks. In study 2, we examined the decrement in the same task with the factorial inclusion of rest breaks and goal switches late in the task. The inclusion of rest breaks resulted in a significant cubic trend in perceptual sensitivity. After the first rest break, there was a reversal of the linear downward decrement in perceptual sensitivity, but the second rest break did not elicit this change. The inclusion of goal switches did not cause any significant deviation from the linear trend and did not attenuate the decrement. In addition, the inclusion of rest breaks resulted in reduced self-reported effort and temporal demand. The results of the present study cohere with the expectations of a resource depletion account of the vigilance decrement.},

Results The published range of MCI prevalence estimates was 5.0\%–36.7\%. This was reduced with all cognitive impairment definitions: performance in the bottom 6.681\% (3.2\%–10.8\%); Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 (1.8\%–14.9\%); Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24–27 (2.1\%–20.7\%). Prevalences using the first definition were 5.9\% overall, and increased with age (P {$<$} .001) but were unaffected by sex or the main races/ethnicities investigated (Whites and Chinese). Not completing high school increased the likelihood of MCI (P .01). Conclusion Applying uniform criteria to harmonized data greatly reduced the variation in MCI prevalence internationally.},

  abstract = {Background: The Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (Sydney MAS) was initiated in 2005 to examine the clinical characteristics and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and related syndromes, and to determine the rate of change in cognitive function over time. Methods: Non-demented community-dwelling individuals (N = 1037) aged 70–90 were recruited from two areas of Sydney, following a random approach to 8914 individuals on the electoral roll. They underwent detailed neuropsychiatric and medical assessments and donated a blood sample for clinical chemistry, proteomics and genomics. A knowledgeable informant was also interviewed. Structural MRI scans were performed on 554 individuals, and subgroups participated in studies of falls and balance, metabolic and inflammatory markers, functional MRI and prospective memory. The cohort is to be followed up with brief telephone reviews annually, and detailed assessments biannually. Results: This is a generally well-functioning cohort mostly living in private homes and rating their health as being better than average, although vascular risk factors are common. Most (95.5\%) participants or their informants identified a cognitive difficulty, and 43.5\% had impairment on at least one neuropsychological test. MCI criteria were met by 34.8\%; with19.3\% qualifying for amnestic MCI, whereas 15.5\% had non-amnestic MCI; 1.6\% had impairment on neuropsychological test performance but no subjective complaints; and 5.8\% could not be classified. The rate of MCI was 30.9\% in the youngest (70–75) and 39.1\% in the oldest (85–90) age bands. Rates of depression and anxiety were 7.1\% and 6.9\% respectively. Conclusions: Cognitive complaints are common in the elderly, and nearly one in three meet criteria for MCI. Longitudinal follow-up of this cohort will delineate the progression of complaints and objective cognitive impairment, and the determinants of such change.},

We applied correlation analysis to find statistically significant features associated with stress and used machine learning to classify whether the participants were stressed or not. In comparison to a baseline 87.5\% accuracy using the surveys, our results showed over 75\% accuracy in a binary classification using screen on, mobility, call or activity level information (some showed higher accuracy than the baseline). The correlation analysis showed that the higherreported stress level was related to activity level, SMS and screen on/off patterns.},

  abstract = {"The lordship of Christ should include an interest in the arts," writes Francis Schaeffer. "A Christian should use these arts to the glory of God, not just as tracts, mind you, but as things of beauty to the praise of God." Many Christians, wary of creating graven images, have steered clear of artistic creativity. But the Bible offers a robust affirmation of the arts. The human impulse to create reflects our being created in the image of a creator God. Art and the Bible has been a foundational work for generations of Christians in the arts. In this book's classic essays, Francis Schaeffer first examines the scriptural record of the use of various art forms, and then establishes a Christian perspective on art. With clarity and vigor, Schaeffer explains why "the Christian is the one whose imagination should fly beyond the stars."},

  abstract = {Animals respond to stress by activating a wide array of behavioral and physiological responses that are collectively referred to as the stress response. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a central role in the stress response by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In response to stress, CRF initiates a cascade of events that culminate in the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. As a result of the great number of physiological and behavioral effects exerted by glucocorticoids, several mechanisms have evolved to control HPA axis activation and integrate the stress response. Glucocorticoid feedback inhibition plays a prominent role in regulating the magnitude and duration of glucocorticoid release. In addition to glucocorticoid feedback, the HPA axis is regulated at the level of the hypothalamus by a diverse group of afferent projections from limbic, mid-brain, and brain stem nuclei. The stress response is also mediated in part by brain stem noradrenergic neurons, sympathetic andrenornedullary circuits, and parasympathetic systems. In summary, the aim of this review is to discuss the role of the HPA axis in the integration of adaptive responses to stress. We also identify and briefly describe the major neuronal and endocrine systems that contribute to the regulation of the HPA axis and the maintenance of homeostasis in the face of aversive stimuli.},

For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change management effort and the redesign of conventional models of care. Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the long-term, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.},

  abstract = {This committee was appointed by the SPR Board to provide recommendations for publishing data on electrodermal activity (EDA). They are intended to be a stand-alone source for newcomers and experienced users. A short outline of principles for electrodermal measurement is given, and recommendations from an earlier report (Fowles et al., 1981) are incorporated. Three fundamental techniques of EDA recording are described: (1) endosomatic recording without the application of an external current, (2) exosomatic recording with direct current (the most widely applied methodology), and (3) exosomatic recording with alternating current—to date infrequently used but a promising future methodology. In addition to EDA recording in laboratories, ambulatory recording has become an emerging technique. Specific problems that come with this recording of EDA in the field are discussed, as are those emerging from recording EDA within a magnetic field (e.g., fMRI). Recommendations for the details that should be mentioned in publications of EDA methods and results are provided.},

There has been a wealth of literature for algorithmic fairness in regression and classification however there has been little exploration of the field for survival analysis. Survival analysis is the prediction task in which one attempts to predict the probability of an event occurring over time. Survival predictions are particularly important in sensitive settings such as when utilising machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis of patients. In this paper we explore how to utilise existing survival metrics to measure bias with group fairness metrics. We explore this in an empirical experiment with 29 survival datasets and 8 measures. We find that measures of discrimination are able to capture bias well whereas there is less clarity with measures of calibration and scoring rules. We suggest further areas for research including prediction-based fairness metrics for distribution predictions.},

Bacteriological tests were performed in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium on solid agar plates and in liquid systems supplemented with different concentrations of nanosized silver particles. These particles were shown to be an effective bactericide. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) were used to study the biocidal action of this nanoscale material. The results confirmed that the treated E.~coli cells were damaged, showing formation of “pits” in the cell wall of the bacteria, while the silver nanoparticles were found to accumulate in the bacterial membrane. A~membrane with such a morphology exhibits a significant increase in permeability, resulting in death of the cell. These nontoxic nanomaterials, which can be prepared in a simple and cost-effective manner, may be suitable for the formulation of new types of bactericidal materials.},

Statements made in the course of interrogationby arrested terrorists(especially by supergrasses,referredto in Italy as 'repenters')as well as ideologicaldocuments disseminated internationallyon the internet or items seized in the course of various judicial enquiries consistently show that the religious view of the world, obviously in the distorted perspective specific to terrorists, constitutes the main reasonfor their behaviour,whereas practicallyno importanceattaches to the aspiration to liberate specific occupied territoriesor oppressed peoples. Another possible motivation, at leastfor suicidal acts, is linked with those of an economic nature: in connection with various judicialinvestigationsit has emerged that sums of money collected as voluntary contributions from the faithful' serves not to finance the 'terrorist act' as such, but to guarantee a future for family members of a suicide attacker,or someone who died in the course of a terroristaction.},

  abstract = {Mobile phones, due to their audio processing capabilities, have the potential to facilitate the diagnosis of heart disease through automated auscultation. However, such a platform is likely to be used by non-experts, and hence, it is essential that such a device is able to automatically differentiate poor quality from diagnostically useful recordings since non-experts are more likely to make poor-quality recordings. This paper investigates the automated signal quality assessment of heart sound recordings performed using both mobile phone-based and commercial medicalgrade electronic stethoscopes. The recordings, each 60 s long, were taken from 151 random adult individuals with varying diagnoses referred to a cardiac clinic and were professionally annotated by five experts. A mean voting procedure was used to compute a final quality label for each recording. Nine signal quality indices were defined and calculated for each recording. A logistic regression model for classifying binary quality was then trained and tested. The interrater agreement level for the stethoscope and mobile phone recordings was measured using Conger’s kappa for multiclass sets and found to be 0.24 and 0.54, respectively. One-third of all the mobile phone-recorded phonocardiogram (PCG) signals were found to be of sufficient quality for analysis. The classifier was able to distinguish good- and poor-quality mobile phone recordings with 82.2\% accuracy, and those made with the electronic stethoscope with an accuracy of 86.5\%. We conclude that our classification approach provides a mechanism for substantially improving auscultation recordings by non-experts. This work is the first systematic evaluation of a PCG signal quality classification algorithm (using a separate test dataset) and assessment of the quality of PCG recordings captured by non-experts, using both a medicalgrade digital stethoscope and a mobile phone.},

Whether markers reflecting the impact of growth restriction on the cardiovascular system, computed from a Doppler-derived heart rate signal, would be suitable in its detection antenatally were studied. Material and Methods: We used a cardiotocography archive of 1163 IUGR cases and 1163 healthy controls, matched for gestation and gender. We assessed the discriminative power of short-term variability (STV) and long-term variability (LTV) of the fetal heart rate, computed over episodes of high and low variation aiming to separate growth-restricted fetuses from controls. Metrics characterizing the sleep state distribution within a trace were also considered for inclusion into an IUGR detection model. Results: Significant differences in the risk markers comparing growth-restricted with healthy fetuses were found. When used in a logistic regression classifier, their performance for identifying IUGR was considerably superior before 34 weeks gestation. LTV in active sleep was superior to STV (AUROC of 72\% compared to 71\%). Most predictive was the number of minutes in high variation per hour (AUROC of 75\%). A multivariate IUGR prediction model improved the AUROC to 76\%. Conclusion: We suggest that heart rate variability markers together with surrogate information on sleep states can contribute to the detection of early-onset IUGR.},

Perinatal and maternal mortality is of particular concern with millions dying every year from potentially treatable conditions. Guatemala has one of the worst maternal mortality ratios, the highest incidence of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), and one of the lowest gross national incomes per capita within Latin America. To address the lack of decision support in rural Guatemala, a smartphone-based system is proposed including peripheral sensors, such as a handheld Doppler for the identification of foetal compromise. Designed for use by illiterate birth attendants, the system uses pictograms, audio guidance, local and cloud processing, SMS alerts and voice calling. The initial prototype was evaluated on 22 women in highland Guatemala. Results were fed back into the refinement of the system, currently undergoing RCT evaluation.},

  abstract = {Disease identification is a core, routine activity in observational health research. Cohorts impact downstream analyses, such as how a condition is characterized, how patient risk is defined, and what treatments are studied. It is thus critical to ensure that selected cohorts are representative of all patients, independently of their demographics or social determinants of health. While there are multiple potential sources of bias when constructing phenotype definitions which may affect their fairness, it is not standard in the field of phenotyping to consider the impact of different definitions across subgroups of patients. In this paper, we propose a set of best practices to assess the fairness of phenotype definitions. We leverage established fairness metrics commonly used in predictive models and relate them to commonly used epidemiological cohort description metrics. We describe an empirical study for Crohn's disease and diabetes type 2, each with multiple phenotype definitions taken from the literature across two sets of patient subgroups (gender and race). We show that the different phenotype definitions exhibit widely varying and disparate performance according to the different fairness metrics and subgroups. We hope that the proposed best practices can help in constructing fair and inclusive phenotype definitions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This naturalistic study used claims data to examine the relationship of medication nonadherence to hospital use and costs among severely mentally ill clients in Wisconsin. METHODS: Data for 619 clients were obtained from Medicaid drug and hospital claims, county records, and case managers as part of a larger study in eight county-based mental health systems. Study participants were eligible for Medicaid, had a severe and persistent mental illness, were 18 years or older, and were receiving neuroleptics, lithium, or antidepressants. Drug claims were analyzed for a 12-month period to determine how regularly clients obtained their medications. Regression analyses were used to assess the effects of irregular medication use on any hospitalization for psychiatric problems, the number of days hospitalized, and hospital costs. The analyses controlled for several risk factors. RESULTS: Among clients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 31 percent used medications irregularly. The rates were 33 percent among those with bipolar disorder and 41 percent among those with other severe mental illnesses. In the total sample, irregular users had significantly higher rates of hospitalization than regular users (42 percent versus 20 percent), more hospital days (16 days versus four days), and higher hospital costs (\$3,992 versus \$1,048). Irregular medication use was one of the strongest predictors of hospital use and costs even after the analyses controlled for diagnosis, demographic characteristics, baseline functioning, and previous hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of drug claims data and the ability to use them in predictive analyses make them a potentially useful data source in studies of medication adherence among persons with severe mental illness.},

  abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the safety of tonsillectomy in a shortterm medical mission setting. Study Design. Retrospective chart review. Setting. Catholic mission hospital in Guatemala. Subjects and Methods. During 7 consecutive annual mission trips from 2004 to 2010, patients received tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy. Established safety protocol requires candidates for tonsillectomy to agree to stay within 1 hour of the hospital for 10 days following the operation. This study includes all tonsillectomy patients regardless of age or indication for tonsillectomy. The primary outcome measures include posttonsillectomy hemorrhage, nasopharyngeal reflux, readmission for dehydration, and mortality. This is a novel study as the work performed by most short-term medical missions is unregulated and unevaluated. Results. Medical charts were available for 197 (96.6\%) of the 204 patients receiving tonsillectomy in the 7-year period; this was the only inclusion criterion. Ninety-nine (50.3\%) patients had tonsillectomy concomitantly with adenoidectomy. Patients ranged in age from 3 to 66 years. The mean (SD) age was 17.2 (14.0) years. The study team found documentation of postoperative complications in 3 (1.5\%) patients; 2 experienced postoperative hemorrhage, 1 within the first postoperative hour and 1 at 96 hours. The final patient returned to the hospital within 24 hours symptomatic for dehydration. Conclusions. The authors have evaluated a protocol for tonsillectomy patients in a specific setting and believe their data represent satisfactory outcomes for the reviewed patients. The generalizability of this information is uncertain, but safety protocols should be established on all short-term medical missions to prevent untoward complications.},

This paper focuses on the terrorism affected countries to determine what actually causes terrorism. The paper utilized a comprehensive sample of 94 countries from 2005 to 2016 and employed suitable econometric techniques to estimate the specified models. The results revealed that low per capita income and political instability are the main driving forces behind prevalent terrorism. Similarly, the growths of both physical as well as human capital have reduced terrorism whilst inflation and government consumption have positively influenced terrorism. The role of military expenditures is observed to be dual as it impacted terrorism negatively in Muslim countries and positively in non-Muslim countries. Decreased corruption is found to be insignificant for the sample as whole but appeared to be having a negative impact on terrorism when the sample is divided between Muslim and non-Muslim countries. The robustness exercise has also revealed similar findings. Lastly, we found bidirectional causality between political instability and terrorism, political instability and corruption, government consumption and inflation and the growth of GDP per capita and the growth of physical capital stock. The paper suggests that countries where terrorism is on the rise shall focus on increasing income of the population, education, capital stock along with ensuring political stability to eradicate the problem of terrorism.},

In this paper, we take a major step in the automatic detection of advertisements suspected to pertain to human trafficking. We present a novel dataset called Trafficking-10k, with more than 10,000 advertisements annotated for this task. The dataset contains two sources of information per advertisement: text and images. For the accurate detection of trafficking advertisements, we designed and trained a deep multimodal model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN).},

Objective: To compare COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD, overall and stratified by age. Methods: Data from the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network platform was used to identify COVID-19 patients. Analysis focused on trends in comorbidities, number of cases, number of deaths, and casefatality rate among patients with and without IDD who had a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through May 14, 2020. Results: People with IDD had higher prevalence of specific comorbidities associated with poorer COVID19 outcomes. Distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends were present among those with IDD, with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases at younger ages. In addition, while the overall casefatality rate was similar for those with IDD (5.1\%) and without IDD (5.4\%), these rates differed by age: ages  17 e IDD 1.6\%, without IDD {$<$}0.01\%; ages 18e74 e IDD 4.5\%, without IDD 2.7\%; ages  75e IDD 21.1\%, without IDD, 20.7\%. Conclusions: Though of concern for all individuals, COVID-19 appears to present a greater risk to people with IDD, especially at younger ages. Future research should seek to document COVID-19 trends among people with IDD, with particular attention to age related trends.},

Nevertheless, recent studies have attempted to improve FHR estimation; however, these methods were developed and tested using datasets composed of few subjects and are therefore unlikely to be generalizable on a population level. The work presented here introduces a reproducible and generalizable autocorrelation (AC)-based method for FHR estimation from onedimensional Doppler ultrasound (1D-DUS) signals.},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of conducting this study was to identify areas of concordance and sources of variation for the published rates of prevalence and incidence associated with various definitions for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: The study used systematic review of studies published in English since 1984. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Population-based observational studies of incidence or prevalence of MCI and related terms were eligible for inclusion. Results: A total of 3,705 citations were identified, and 42 were accepted for inclusion; 35 included data on prevalence and 13 on incidence. The following four terms predominated: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI); cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND); MCI; and amnestic MCI (aMCI). Within each term, the operational definition varied. Substantial variation was observed for both incidence (MCI: 21.5–71.3; aMCI: 8.5–25.9 per 1,000 person-years) and prevalence of each definition of cognitive impairment (AAMI 3.6\%–38.4\%; CIND 5.1\%–35.9\%; MCI 3\%–42\%; aMCI 0.5\%–31.9\%). CIND and MCI showed increasing prevalence among older age groups, whereas agespecific rates of aMCI were lower and without any apparent age relationship. Conclusions: Prevalence and incidence estimates associated with MCI vary greatly both between definitions and within a definition across the 42 publications. These wide differences pose a significant challenge to our understanding of the social burden of this disease. Enhancement and standardization of operational definitions of the subtypes of cognitive impairment could improve estimates of disease burden and provide a mechanism to assist in the identification of individuals at risk for future Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.},

Methods: A total of 787 community-dwelling Chinese older adults without dementia in Hong Kong were assessed at baseline (T0), at two years (T1), and at five years (T2). Results: The annual conversion rate to dementia was 1.6\% and 6.3\% for baseline normal participants and baseline mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, respectively. The Cantonese version of Mini-mental State Examination (CMMSE) scores declined significantly over time. In participants who progressed to dementia, Category Verbal Fluency Test (CVFT) scores dropped significantly from T0 to T1. A 1-SD drop of either CMMSE or CVFT in two years predicted dementia at five years with 91.5\% sensitivity and 62.0\% specificity. A stable CMMSE and CVFT at two years predicted a 91\% chance of not progressing to clinical dementia at five years. Conclusion: In this community sample of Chinese older adults, a decline in cognitive screening tests in short term (two years) offered useful information in predicting dementia conversion over a longer period.},

While promising biosensors for various applications are constantly being developed in the laboratories across the world, many struggle to maintain reliable functionality in complex in vivo environments over time. In this review, we explore the impact of various biotic and abiotic failure modes on the reliability of implantable biosensors. We discuss various design considerations for the development of chronically reliable implantable biosensors with a specific focus on strategies to combat biofouling, which is a fundamental challenge for many implantable devices. Briefly, we introduce the process of the foreign body response and compare the in vitro and the in vivo performances of state-of-the-art implantable biosensors. We then discuss the latest development in material science to minimize and delay biofouling including the usage of various hydrophilic, biomimetic, drug-eluting, zwitterionic, and other smart polymer materials. We also explore a number of active anti-biofouling approaches including stimuli-responsive materials and mechanical actuation. Finally, we conclude this topical review with a discussion on future research opportunities towards more reliable implantable biosensors.},

We leverage the fact that wireless signals in the WiFi frequencies traverse walls and reflect off the human body. We introduce a deep neural network approach that parses such radio signals to estimate 2D poses. Since humans cannot annotate radio signals, we use state-of-the-art vision model to provide cross-modal supervision. Specifically, during training the system uses synchronized wireless and visual inputs, extracts pose information from the visual stream, and uses it to guide the training process. Once trained, the network uses only the wireless signal for pose estimation. We show that, when tested on visible scenes, the radio-based system is almost as accurate as the vision-based system used to train it. Yet, unlike vision-based pose estimation, the radio-based system can estimate 2D poses through walls despite never trained on such scenarios. Demo videos are available at our website.},
